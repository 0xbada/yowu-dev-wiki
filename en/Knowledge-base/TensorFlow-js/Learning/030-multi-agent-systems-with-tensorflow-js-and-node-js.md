# 030: Multi-Agent Systems with TensorFlow.js and Node.js

In this post, we'll learn about multi-agent systems and how to build them using TensorFlow.js and Node.js.

Multi-agent systems are composed of multiple agents that interact with each other to achieve a common goal. They are often used in distributed systems, where each agent has its own local view of the world and must coordinate with other agents to achieve the desired global behavior.

Multi-agent systems can be used to solve a variety of problems, including distributed optimization, planning, and control. In this post, we'll focus on how to use multi-agent systems to solve a distributed optimization problem.

## What is a Multi-Agent System?

A multi-agent system is a system composed of multiple agents that interact with each other. The agents in a multi-agent system can be software agents, robotic agents, or human agents.

Multi-agent systems are often used in distributed systems, where each agent has its own local view of the world and must coordinate with other agents to achieve the desired global behavior.

Multi-agent systems can be used to solve a variety of problems, including distributed optimization, planning, and control.

## How to Build a Multi-Agent System

There are many ways to build a multi-agent system. In this post, we'll focus on how to use TensorFlow.js and Node.js to build a multi-agent system.

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for machine learning. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on your server.

## Step 1: Install TensorFlow.js and Node.js

First, you need to install TensorFlow.js and Node.js.

You can install TensorFlow.js and Node.js using the following commands:

```
npm install -g @tensorflow/tfjs-node
npm install -g node
```

## Step 2: Create a TensorFlow.js Agent

Next, you need to create a TensorFlow.js agent.

A TensorFlow.js agent is a machine learning model that can be used to solve a variety of problems, including distributed optimization.

To create a TensorFlow.js agent, you need to define a model and a optimizer.

You can use the following code to create a simple TensorFlow.js agent:

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

// Define a model.
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));

// Define an optimizer.
const optimizer = tf.train.sgd(0.1);

// Create the TensorFlow.js agent.
const agent = tf.js.adam(model, optimizer);
```

## Step 3: Train the Agent

Once you have created the agent, you need to train it.

You can use the following code to train the agent:

```javascript
// Train the agent.
agent.fit(x, y, {epochs: 100});
```

## Step 4: Use the Agent

After the agent has been trained, you can use it to solve a variety of problems.

In this post, we'll use the agent to solve a distributed optimization problem.

## Distributed Optimization

Distributed optimization is a problem that can be solved using a multi-agent system.

In distributed optimization, a set of agents are each given a local objective function. The agents must then cooperate to find a global solution that minimizes the sum of the local objective functions.

## Example: Distributed Optimization with TensorFlow.js

In this example, we'll use TensorFlow.js to solve a distributed optimization problem.

We'll use the agent we created in Step 3 to solve the problem.

First, we need to define the local objective functions.

We can use the following code to define the local objective functions:

```javascript
// Define the local objective functions.
const f1 = (x) => x.pow(tf.tensor1d([2]));
const f2 = (x) => x.abs();
const f3 = (x) => x.sin();
```

Next, we need to define the global objective function.

The global objective function is the sum of the local objective functions.

We can use the following code to define the global objective function:

```javascript
// Define the global objective function.
const F = (x) => f1(x).add(f2(x)).add(f3(x));
```

Finally, we need to define the optimizer.

The optimizer is used to find the global solution that minimizes the global objective function.

We can use the following code to define the optimizer:

```javascript
// Define the optimizer.
const optimizer = tf.train.sgd(0.1);
```

Now that we have defined the objective functions and the optimizer, we can use the agent to solve the distributed optimization problem.

We can use the following code to use the agent to solve the distributed optimization problem:

```javascript
// Use the agent to solve the distributed optimization problem.
agent.minimize(F, optimizer);
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we learned about multi-agent systems and how to build them using TensorFlow.js and Node.js.

We also learned how to use a multi-agent system to solve a distributed optimization problem.
