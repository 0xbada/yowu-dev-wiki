# 100: Advanced Topics in TensorFlow.js and Node.js: Research and Applications

In this post, we'll explore some advanced topics in TensorFlow.js and Node.js. We'll cover research and applications for these technologies so that you can get started using them in your own projects.

## What is TensorFlow.js?

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models. It's open source and easy to use, and it allows you to train and deploy models directly in the browser.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. It's open source and easy to use, and it's becoming increasingly popular for server-side programming.

## Research and Applications

Now that we've covered some basics, let's explore some of the research and applications for TensorFlow.js and Node.js.

### TensorFlow.js
