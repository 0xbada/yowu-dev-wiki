# MySQL Fundamentals for Non-Developers: How to Get the Most Out of Your Data

MySQL is a powerful database management system that is used by many large websites and applications. If you are not a developer, you may not be familiar with MySQL. However, there are many reasons why you might want to learn about MySQL.

For example, you may want to:

- Understand how your website or application stores data
- Learn how to backup and restore your data
- Improve the performance of your website or application
- Learn how to secure your data

In this post, we will cover the basics of MySQL. We will learn about the MySQL server, how to connect to it, and how to run basic SQL queries. By the end of this post, you will have a good understanding of MySQL and be able to start using it to get the most out of your data.

## What is MySQL?

MySQL is a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS is a software that is used to store, retrieve, and manage data. MySQL is a popular DBMS that is used by many large websites and applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

MySQL is a relational DBMS. This means that it stores data in tables. Tables are similar to folders in a file system. They are used to organize data so that it can be easily found and retrieved.

## The MySQL Server

The MySQL server is the software that runs the MySQL database. It is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data. The MySQL server can be installed on a computer, server, or virtual machine.

To use MySQL, you must connect to the MySQL server. You can do this using a MySQL client. A MySQL client is a software that allows you to connect to the MySQL server and run SQL queries.

## Connecting to the MySQL Server

To connect to the MySQL server, you need the following information:

- The hostname of the server
- The port number of the server
- The username
- The password

The hostname is the address of the server. The port number is the number that the server is listening on. The default port number for the MySQL server is 3306.

The username is the name of the user that you will use to connect to the server. The password is the password for the user.

## Running SQL Queries

Once you have connected to the MySQL server, you can run SQL queries. SQL is the language that is used to interact with databases. It is used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.

To run a SQL query, you must first select a database. A database is a collection of tables. To select a database, use the following SQL query:

    USE database_name;

Replace database_name with the name of the database that you want to use.

Once you have selected a database, you can run SQL queries on the database. For example, the following SQL query will retrieve all of the data from the table named table_name:

    SELECT * FROM table_name;

Replace table_name with the name of the table that you want to query.

## Getting the Most Out of MySQL

MySQL is a powerful database management system. By learning the basics of MySQL, you will be able to get the most out of your data.
