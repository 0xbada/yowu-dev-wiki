# Building reactive user interfaces with functional programming in JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for everything from building web applications to working with data. In recent years, there has been a shift towards using JavaScript for more complex applications, including user interfaces.

User interfaces are a crucial part of any application. They need to be responsive, meaning that they should update in real-time as the user interacts with the application. This can be a challenge to achieve, but using a functional programming approach can help.

In this post, we'll take a look at what reactive user interfaces are and how you can build them using a functional programming approach in JavaScript.

## What are reactive user interfaces?

Reactive user interfaces are those that update in real-time as the user interacts with the application. This can be in response to user input, such as typing in a search field, or to changes in data, such as new items being added to a list.

Reactive user interfaces need to be able to handle multiple input types and update the UI accordingly. They should also be able to handle changes to data that may come from external sources, such as a server.

Building reactive user interfaces can be a challenge, but using a functional programming approach can help.

## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on using functions to work with data. In contrast to other programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, functional programming does not use objects or classes.

Instead, functional programming relies on functions to work with data. This data can be in the form of variables, lists, or even other functions.

Functional programming has a number of benefits, including the fact that it can make code more readable and easier to reason about. It can also make code more reusable and easier to test.

When it comes to building reactive user interfaces, functional programming can be particularly useful. This is because functional programming can help to make code more declarative.

## What is declarative programming?

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on what the code should do, rather than how it should do it. In contrast to other programming paradigms, such as procedural programming, declarative programming does not focus on specifying the steps that the code should take.

Instead, declarative programming focuses on specifying the desired outcome. This can make code more readable and easier to reason about.

When it comes to building reactive user interfaces, declarative programming can be particularly useful. This is because it can help to make code more concise and easier to reason about.

## How can you use functional programming to build reactive user interfaces?

There are a number of ways that you can use functional programming to build reactive user interfaces. We'll take a look at two of the most common approaches: using React and using Vue.

### Using React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is declarative, meaning that it focuses on what the UI should look like, rather than how it should be implemented.

React uses a concept called the virtual DOM, which is a representation of the UI in memory. When the UI needs to be updated, React will update the virtual DOM and then compare it to the real DOM.

This comparison is used to determine what changes need to be made to the UI. React will then make these changes in an efficient way, meaning that the UI will always be up-to-date.

React is a popular choice for building reactive user interfaces, and it can be used with a functional programming approach.

### Using Vue

Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is also declarative, meaning that it focuses on what the UI should look like, rather than how it should be implemented.

Vue uses a concept called the virtual DOM, which is a representation of the UI in memory. When the UI needs to be updated, Vue will update the virtual DOM and then compare it to the real DOM.

This comparison is used to determine what changes need to be made to the UI. Vue will then make these changes in an efficient way, meaning that the UI will always be up-to-date.

Vue is another popular choice for building reactive user interfaces, and it can also be used with a functional programming approach.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've taken a look at what reactive user interfaces are and how you can use a functional programming approach to build them.

Reactive user interfaces are those that update in real-time as the user interacts with the application. This can be in response to user input, such as typing in a search field, or to changes in data, such as new items being added to a list.

Building reactive user interfaces can be a challenge, but using a functional programming approach can help. This is because functional programming can help to make code more declarative.

When it comes to using a functional programming approach to build reactive user interfaces, there are a number of options available. React and Vue are two of the most popular choices.
