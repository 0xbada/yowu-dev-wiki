# 022: An introduction to monads in functional programming with JavaScript

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the evaluation of functions. In functional programming, functions are considered first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned from functions.

JavaScript is a programming language that supports functional programming. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.

Monads are a type of structure that can be used in functional programming to improve code readability and maintainability. Monads are used to encapsulate values and computations.

In this post, we will take a look at what monads are and how they can be used in JavaScript.

## What are monads?

Monads are a type of structure that can be used in functional programming to improve code readability and maintainability. Monads are used to encapsulate values and computations.

Monads are structures that can be used to encapsulate values and computations. Monads provide a way to abstract away the details of a computation.

Monads are used to encapsulate values and computations. Monads are used to abstract away the details of a computation. Monads are used to provide a way to structure code.

Monads can be thought of as containers for values. A monad can be used to encapsulate a value. Monads can also be used to encapsulate a computation.
