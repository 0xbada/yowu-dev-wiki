#010: Functional programming for big data applications in JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both functional and object-oriented programming. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in functional programming for big data applications.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the evaluation of functions rather than the execution of commands. This paradigm is well suited for big data applications because it can help to simplify and optimize code.

There are many different ways to achieve functional programming in JavaScript. One popular approach is to use higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or that return a function as a result.

Examples of higher-order functions include map, filter, and reduce. These functions are provided by the Array prototype in JavaScript.

The map function takes a function as an argument and applies that function to each element in an array. The following code shows an example of how to use the map function to square each element in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = numbers.map(x => x * x);
console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The filter function takes a function as an argument and returns a new array that contains only the elements for which the function returns true. The following code shows an example of how to use the filter function to remove all even numbers from an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const oddNumbers = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 1);
console.log(oddNumbers); // [1, 3, 5]
```

The reduce function takes a function as an argument and applies that function to each element in an array, from left to right. The return value of the function is the final value returned by the reduce function. The following code shows an example of how to use the reduce function to sum all the numbers in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15
```

Another popular approach to functional programming in JavaScript is to use the underscore.js library. Underscore.js is a utility library that provides many functions for working with arrays, objects, and functions.

The following code shows an example of how to use the map function from underscore.js to square each element in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = _.map(numbers, x => x * x);
console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The following code shows an example of how to use the filter function from underscore.js to remove all even numbers from an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const oddNumbers = _.filter(numbers, x => x % 2 === 1);
console.log(oddNumbers); // [1, 3, 5]
```

The following code shows an example of how to use the reduce function from underscore.js to sum all the numbers in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = _.reduce(numbers, (a, b) => a + b, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15
```

Functional programming can be a powerful tool for big data applications. By using higher-order functions or the underscore.js library, you can simplify and optimize your code.
