# Kubernetes Operators: Automating Application Management with Custom Controllers

In this article, we'll be discussing Kubernetes Operators. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating containerized applications. Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. In this article, we'll focus on what an Operator is and how it can help you automate the management of your applications.

## What is an Operator?

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that are used to manage specific types of applications. Operators use custom resources to represent the state of the application and define desired behaviors. Custom controllers watch for changes to these custom resources and make the necessary changes to keep the application running as desired.

Operators are built using Kubernetes APIs and best practices. This makes them portable across Kubernetes implementations and allows them to be easily extended.

## Why use an Operator?

Operators offer a declarative approach to application management. This means that you can describe the desired state of an application and the Operator will ensure that the application reaches and remains in that state.

Operators also offer a way to automate the management of your applications. Applications can be complex and require many different components to be deployed and configured correctly. This can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. Operators can automate this process, making it easier and faster to deploy and manage your applications.

Operators can also help you manage the lifecycle of your applications. This includes tasks such as upgrading and downgrade applications, as well as scaling applications up or down.

## How to use an Operator?

Operators are deployed as Custom Resources Definitions (CRDs). CRDs are annotations that are added to existing Kubernetes resources. This allows the Operator to watch for changes to the resource and take the necessary actions.

Operators are also deployed as Custom Controllers. Custom controllers are Kubernetes controllers that watch for changes to Custom Resources. When a change is detected, the controller will take the necessary actions to ensure that the resource reaches the desired state.

## Writing an Operator

Operators are written in Go. The Operator SDK is a toolkit that makes it easy to write, build, and deploy Kubernetes Operators. The SDK provides a CLI, scaffolding, and testing tools.

Operators are built using Kubernetes APIs and best practices. This makes them portable across Kubernetes implementations and allows them to be easily extended.

The Operator SDK CLI can be used to generate the scaffolding for an Operator. This includes the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and the Custom Controller.

Once the scaffolding has been generated, the Operator can be implemented. The Operator will need to watch for changes to the Custom Resource and take the necessary actions.

Operators can be deployed to Kubernetes using kubectl or the Operator SDK CLI.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've discussed Kubernetes Operators. We've covered what an Operator is and how it can help you automate the management of your applications. We've also looked at how to write and deploy an Operator.
