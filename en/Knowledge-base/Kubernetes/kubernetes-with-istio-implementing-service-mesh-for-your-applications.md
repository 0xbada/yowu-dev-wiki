# Kubernetes with Istio: Implementing Service Mesh for Your Applications

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.

Service mesh is a configurable infrastructure layer for microservices application that makes communication between services reliable, fast, and secure. A service mesh typically consists of a data plane and a control plane. The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies that mediate communication between microservices. The control plane manages and configures the proxies.

Istio is a service mesh for Kubernetes. It is composed of a data plane and a control plane. The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies that mediate communication between microservices. The control plane manages and configures the proxies.

Kubernetes with Istio can be used to implement a service mesh for your applications. In this article, we will show you how to install and configure Istio on a Kubernetes cluster, and how to deploy a sample microservices application.

## Installing Istio on Kubernetes

Istio can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager. Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes applications.

To install Istio, you need to first install Helm and add the Istio Helm repository.

### Installing Helm

Download the Helm binary from the [Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm).

Extract the helm binary and add it to your PATH.

```
tar xzf helm-v2.16.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/
```

Initialize Helm and install Tiller, the server-side component of Helm.

```
helm init
```

### Adding the Istio Helm Repository

Add the Istio Helm repository.

```
helm repo add istio.io https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-release/releases/1.5.2/charts/
```

Update the Helm repository.

```
helm repo update
```

## Deploying a Sample Microservices Application

We will deploy a sample microservices application consisting of four services:

- A frontend service written in Node.js
- A backend service written in Golang
- A database service
- A load balancer service

The frontend and backend services will be deployed in separate pods. The database service will be deployed in a separate pod. The load balancer service will be deployed in a separate pod.

The frontend service will make requests to the backend service. The backend service will make requests to the database service. The load balancer service will route traffic to the frontend and backend services.

We will deploy the application using the Istio Helm chart.

### Installing the Istio Helm Chart

Install the Istio Helm chart with the following command:

```
helm install --name istio-system -f /path/to/custom-values.yaml istio.io/istio
```

The Istio Helm chart is installed in the `istio-system` namespace.

### Deploying the Frontend Service

Create a pod for the frontend service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: frontend
    image: node:12-alpine
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
```

Deploy the pod.

```
kubectl apply -f /path/to/frontend-pod.yaml
```

### Deploying the Backend Service

Create a pod for the backend service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: backend
  labels:
    app: backend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: backend
    image: golang:1.14-alpine
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
```

Deploy the pod.

```
kubectl apply -f /path/to/backend-pod.yaml
```

### Deploying the Database Service

Create a pod for the database service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: database
  labels:
    app: database
spec:
  containers:
  - name: database
    image: mysql:5.7
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3306
```

Deploy the pod.

```
kubectl apply -f /path/to/database-pod.yaml
```

### Deploying the Load Balancer Service

Create a pod for the load balancer service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: load-balancer
  labels:
    app: load-balancer
spec:
  containers:
  - name: load-balancer
    image: nginx:1.17.9-alpine
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Deploy the pod.

```
kubectl apply -f /path/to/load-balancer-pod.yaml
```

### Testing the Application

To test the application, we will send a request to the load balancer service. The load balancer service will route the request to the frontend service. The frontend service will make a request to the backend service. The backend service will make a request to the database service.

First, we need to get the IP address of the load balancer service.

```
kubectl get svc
```

The output should look like this:

```
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
frontend        ClusterIP      10.108.1.194     <none>        3000/TCP         1m
backend         ClusterIP      10.96.247.199    <none>        3000/TCP         1m
database        ClusterIP      10.111.142.247   <none>        3306/TCP         1m
load-balancer   LoadBalancer   10.102.129.251   <pending>     80:32000/TCP     1m
```

The load balancer service has a `ClusterIP` of `10.102.129.251` and a `PORT` of `80:32000`.

We can now send a request to the load balancer service.

```
curl -v http://10.102.129.251:80
```

The output should look like this:

```
*   Trying 10.102.129.251:80...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 10.102.129.251 (10.102.129.251) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 10.102.129.251:80
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/html
< Content-Length: 28
<
<html>
<body>
Hello, World!
</body>
</html>
* Connection #0 to host 10.102.129.251 left intact
```

The request was routed to the frontend service and the response was returned.
