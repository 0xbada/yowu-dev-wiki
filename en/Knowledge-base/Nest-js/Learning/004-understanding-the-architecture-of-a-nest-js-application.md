# Understanding the architecture of a Nest.js application

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (that compiles to JavaScript) and combines elements of Object-Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and Reactive Programming.

Nest.js applications are organized into a set of nested modules. Nest.js modules are equivalent to Angular modules and are used to group together related components, services, pipes, and directives.

The main purpose of a Nest.js module is to provide a single place (or root) where all the related code for a single feature or domain can be found. This makes it easy to reason about and maintain Nest.js applications.

Nest.js modules are organized into a hierarchical structure with a root module and zero or more child modules. The root module is the entry point for the application and is typically used to configure the Nest.js application. Child modules are used to group together related code for a feature or domain.

The figure below shows the typical structure of a Nest.js application. The src directory contains the source code for the application. The app.module.ts file is the root module and is used to configure the Nest.js application. The child modules are used to group together related code for a feature or domain.

The src/app.module.ts file is the root module and is used to configure the Nest.js application. The @Nestjs/common module is imported and used to provide the CommonModule class. The CommonModule class is used to provide the injector service. The injector service is used to resolve dependencies.

The @Nestjs/core module is imported and used to provide the NestFactory class. The NestFactory class is used to create a Nest.js application instance.

The AppModule class is imported and used to define the AppModule class. The AppModule class is used to configure the Nest.js application.

The NestFactory class returns an instance of the Nest.js application.

The instance of the Nest.js application is used to start the Nest.js application.

The instance of the Nest.js application is started using the start() method.

The start() method is used to start the Nest.js application.

The start() method takes a port number as an argument. The port number is used to listen for HTTP requests.

The start() method returns a Promise. The Promise is resolved when the Nest.js application is started.

The src/index.ts file is the entry point for the TypeScript compiler. The src/index.ts file is used to compile the TypeScript code.

The src/index.ts file imports the AppModule class. The AppModule class is used to configure the Nest.js application.

The src/index.ts file uses the tsconfig.json file to configure the TypeScript compiler.

The tsconfig.json file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler.

The tsconfig.json file contains the compiler options. The compiler options are used to configure the TypeScript compiler.

The tsconfig.json file is used to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript code.

The TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript code using the tsc command.

The tsc command is used to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript code.

The tsc command takes the tsconfig.json file as an argument. The tsconfig.json file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler.

The tsc command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript code.

The compiled JavaScript code is placed in the dist directory.

The dist directory contains the compiled JavaScript code.

The dist directory is the output directory for the TypeScript compiler.

The Nest.js application is run using the node command.

The node command is used to run the Nest.js application.

The node command takes the compiled JavaScript code as an argument. The compiled JavaScript code is placed in the dist directory.

The node command runs the Nest.js application.

The Nest.js application is run on a Node.js server.

The Node.js server is used to run the Nest.js application.

The Node.js server is a JavaScript runtime.

The Node.js server is used to execute JavaScript code.

The Nest.js application is accessed using a web browser.

The web browser is used to access the Nest.js application.

The web browser is used to send HTTP requests to the Nest.js application.

The Nest.js application is accessed at http://localhost:3000.
