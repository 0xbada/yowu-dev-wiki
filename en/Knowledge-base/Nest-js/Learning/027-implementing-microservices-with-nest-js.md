# Implementing microservices with Nest.js

Microservices are a popular architectural style for building cloud applications that are scalable and resilient. Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications.

In this post, we'll learn how to implement microservices with Nest.js. We'll start by looking at what microservices are and why they're useful. We'll then look at how to create a simple microservice using Nest.js. Finally, we'll learn how to deploy our microservice to a cloud platform.

## What are microservices?

Microservices are a style of software architecture where applications are built as a set of small, independent services. Each service has a single responsibility and can be deployed and scaled independently.

Microservices have a number of benefits over traditional monolithic architectures. They're easier to develop, deploy, and scale. They're also more resilient, since a failure in one service does not affect the other services.

## Creating a microservice with Nest.js

Now that we've seen what microservices are, let's learn how to create a simple microservice using Nest.js.

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications. It uses TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that provides static type checking and other benefits.

To create a Nest.js microservice, we'll use the Nest CLI. The Nest CLI is a command-line interface that makes it easy to create, build, and test Nest.js applications.

First, we'll create a new directory for our microservice:

```
mkdir my-microservice
```

Next, we'll initialize a new Nest.js project in our directory:

```
nest init
```

This will create a file called `package.json` in our directory. This file contains information about our project, including the dependencies that we'll need to install.

Next, we'll install the dependencies for our project:

```
npm install
```

Now that our project is set up, we can start coding our microservice. We'll start by creating a file called `src/app.controller.ts`:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  root(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

This file contains a controller called `AppController`. This controller contains a single method, `root()`, which returns the string `'Hello World!'`.

Next, we'll create a file called `src/app.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';

@Module({
  controllers: [AppController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This file contains a module called `AppModule`. This module contains our `AppController`.

Finally, we'll create a file called `src/main.ts`:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

This file contains the code that will start our microservice. First, we create a new `NestFactory`, which is a factory for creating Nest.js applications. We then pass our `AppModule` to the `NestFactory`. Finally, we call the `listen()` method to start the microservice on port `3000`.

Now that our microservice is complete, we can start it by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

We can then access our microservice at http://localhost:3000.

## Deploying a microservice

Now that we've seen how to create a microservice with Nest.js, let's learn how to deploy it.

There are many different ways to deploy a microservice. In this post, we'll learn how to deploy our microservice to a cloud platform using Docker.

Docker is a tool that makes it easy to package, deploy, and run applications in a container. A container is a self-contained environment that includes everything an application needs to run, such as the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries.

To deploy our microservice to a cloud platform using Docker, we'll first need to create a `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM node:10.16.0-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

This `Dockerfile` contains the instructions for building our Docker image. First, we specify the `node` image that we want to use. Next, we create a working directory for our application. Then, we copy the `package.json` file to our working directory. We use this file to install the dependencies for our application.

Next, we copy the rest of our application code to our working directory. Finally, we expose port `3000` and specify the command that should be run when our container starts.

Now that we have our `Dockerfile`, we can build our Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-microservice .
```

This command will create a Docker image with the tag `my-microservice`. We can then run our Docker image:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-microservice
```

This command will start a container from our `my-microservice` image. The `-d` flag specifies that the container should be run in detached mode. This means that the container will be run in the background. The `-p` flag specifies that port `3000` on our host should be mapped to port `3000` in the container.

We can then access our microservice at http://localhost:3000.

## Conclusion
