# Introduction 

In this post, we're going to explore how to use Nest.js and IndexedDB to build high-performance applications.

We'll cover the following topics:

- What is Nest.js?
- What is IndexedDB?
- Why use Nest.js and IndexedDB together?
- How to use Nest.js and IndexedDB to build a high-performance application.

# What is Nest.js? 

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications. It is heavily inspired by Angular and makes use of TypeScript. 

Nest.js is a great choice for building high-performance applications. It is easy to use and has a wide range of features. 

# What is IndexedDB? 

IndexedDB is a JavaScript-based object-oriented database. It is a transactional database, which means that data is stored in objects and transactions are used to manipulate the data. 

IndexedDB is a great choice for building high-performance applications because it is easy to use and has a wide range of features. 

# Why use Nest.js and IndexedDB together? 

Nest.js and IndexedDB are both great choices for building high-performance applications. Nest.js is a great choice for building scalable server-side applications and IndexedDB is a great choice for building transactional databases. 

Nest.js and IndexedDB are both easy to use and have a wide range of features. Nest.js is heavily inspired by Angular and makes use of TypeScript. IndexedDB is a JavaScript-based object-oriented database. 

Nest.js and IndexedDB are both great choices for building high-performance applications.

# How to use Nest.js and IndexedDB to build a high-performance application. 

In this section, we'll explore how to use Nest.js and IndexedDB to build a high-performance application.

We'll cover the following topics:

- How to create a Nest.js application.
- How to connect to an IndexedDB database.
- How to create a transactional database.
- How to manipulate data in an IndexedDB database.

## How to create a Nest.js application. 

To create a Nest.js application, you need to install the Nest.js CLI. You can do this by running the following command: 

```
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

Once the Nest.js CLI is installed, you can create a new Nest.js application by running the following command: 

```
nest new my-nestjs-app
```

This will create a new Nest.js application in a directory called my-nestjs-app. 

## How to connect to an IndexedDB database. 

To connect to an IndexedDB database, you need to install the IndexedDB driver. You can do this by running the following command: 

```
npm install indexeddb-js
```

Once the IndexedDB driver is installed, you can connect to an IndexedDB database by running the following command: 

```
nest connect my-nestjs-app my-indexeddb-database
```

This will connect to an IndexedDB database called my-indexeddb-database. 

## How to create a transactional database. 

To create a transactional database, you need to install the IndexedDB driver. You can do this by running the following command: 

```
npm install indexeddb-js
```

Once the IndexedDB driver is installed, you can create a transactional database by running the following command: 

```
nest create-database my-nestjs-app my-indexeddb-database
```

This will create a transactional database called my-indexeddb-database. 

## How to manipulate data in an IndexedDB database. 

To manipulate data in an IndexedDB database, you need to install the IndexedDB driver. You can do this by running the following command: 

```
npm install indexeddb-js
```

Once the IndexedDB driver is installed, you can manipulate data in an IndexedDB database by running the following command: 

```
nest manipulate-data my-nestjs-app my-indexeddb-database
```

This will manipulate data in an IndexedDB database called my-indexeddb-database.
