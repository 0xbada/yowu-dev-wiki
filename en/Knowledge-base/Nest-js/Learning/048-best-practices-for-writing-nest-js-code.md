# 048: Best practices for writing Nest.js code

Nest.js is a powerful framework for building Node.js applications. It is built on top of Express.js and makes use of TypeScript, which makes it easy to write well-organized and maintainable code.

In this post, we will take a look at some best practices for writing Nest.js code.

## Use the right coding style

When writing code, it is important to use the right coding style. This will help you to write code that is easy to read and maintain.

There are a few different coding styles you can use for Nest.js code. The most popular one is the Airbnb style guide. This style guide is widely used by the Node.js community and has been adopted by many companies.

Another popular style guide is the StandardJS style guide. This style guide is less opinionated than the Airbnb style guide and is a good choice if you are not sure which style to use.

## Use TypeScript

Nest.js is written in TypeScript and it is recommended that you use TypeScript when writing Nest.js code. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

TypeScript is a great way to write code that is easy to read and maintain. It also helps to prevent errors in your code.

## Use the right dependencies

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right dependencies. There are a few different types of dependencies you can use.

The first type of dependency is a Node.js module. These are modules that are published on npm and can be installed using the npm install command.

The second type of dependency is a TypeScript definition file. These files provide type information for TypeScript. They are not published on npm and must be installed manually.

The third type of dependency is a JavaScript file. These files are not published on npm and must be installed manually.

## Use the right project structure

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right project structure. The recommended project structure for Nest.js is the following:

```
- src
  - controllers
  - services
  - pipes
  - filters
  - interceptors
  - modules
  - middlewares
  - entities
  - dtos
  - providers
  - guards
  - exceptions
  - interceptors
  - main.ts
  - app.module.ts
```

## Use the right naming conventions

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right naming conventions. The recommended naming conventions for Nest.js are the following:

- Controllers should be named *Controller.ts
- Services should be named *Service.ts
- Pipes should be named *Pipe.ts
- Filters should be named *Filter.ts
- Interceptors should be named *Interceptor.ts
- Modules should be named *Module.ts
- Middlewares should be named *Middleware.ts
- Entities should be named *Entity.ts
- Dtos should be named *Dto.ts
- Providers should be named *Provider.ts
- Guards should be named *Guard.ts
- Exceptions should be named *Exception.ts

## Use the right coding patterns

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right coding patterns. The recommended coding patterns for Nest.js are the following:

- Controllers should be thin
- Services should be thick
- Pipes should be used for data transformation
- Filters should be used for data validation
- Interceptors should be used for logging
- Modules should be used for organization
- Middlewares should be used for authentication
- Entities should be used for data modeling
- Dtos should be used for data transfer
- Providers should be used for dependency injection
- Guards should be used for authorization
- Exceptions should be used for error handling

## Use the right testing approach

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right testing approach. The recommended testing approach for Nest.js is the following:

- Use unit tests for small pieces of functionality
- Use integration tests for larger pieces of functionality
- Use end-to-end tests for the entire application

## Use the right tooling

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right tooling. The recommended tooling for Nest.js is the following:

- Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code
- Use a build tool like Gulp
- Use a testing framework like Jest
- Use a linter like TSLint

## Use the right documentation

When writing Nest.js code, it is important to use the right documentation. The recommended documentation for Nest.js is the following:

- Use JSDoc for JavaScript documentation
- Use TypeDoc for TypeScript documentation

## Conclusion

In this post, we have looked at some best practices for writing Nest.js code. We have seen that it is important to use the right coding style, use TypeScript, use the right dependencies, use the right project structure, use the right naming conventions, use the right coding patterns, use the right testing approach, use the right tooling, and use the right documentation.
