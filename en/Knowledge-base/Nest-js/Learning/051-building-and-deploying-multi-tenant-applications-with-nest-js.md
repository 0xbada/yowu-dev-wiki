# Introduction

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and combines the benefits of both Node.js and TypeScript to develop applications.

Nest.js is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and combines the benefits of both Node.js and TypeScript. With Nest.js, you can develop applications that are easier to maintain, easier to scale, and more testable than applications written in vanilla Node.js.

# What is a Multi-tenant Application?

A multi-tenant application is an application that is designed to serve multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access to the application.

Multi-tenant applications are designed to serve multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access to the application.

Multi-tenant applications have a few key features that make them different from traditional applications:

- Each tenant has their own dedicated instance of the application.
- Tenants can be isolated from each other.
- Tenants can be given different levels of access to the application.

# Why Use a Multi-tenant Application?

Multi-tenant applications have a few key advantages over traditional applications:

- Isolation: Tenants are isolated from each other. This means that one tenant's data cannot be accessed by another tenant.
- Security: Tenants can be given different levels of access to the application. This means that you can control who has access to what data.
- Scalability: Each tenant has their own dedicated instance of the application. This means that the application can scale to meet the needs of each tenant.

# How to Build a Multi-tenant Application with Nest.js

Building a multi-tenant application with Nest.js is easy. Nest.js provides a TenantModule that you can use to isolate tenants from each other.

To use the TenantModule, you need to create a TenantModule for each tenant. The TenantModule contains the configuration for the tenant.

```javascript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TenantModule } from '@nestjs/tenant';

@Module({
  imports: [
    TenantModule.forRoot({
      tenants: [
        {
          id: 'tenant-1',
          name: 'Tenant 1',
          database: 'tenant1'
        },
        {
          id: 'tenant-2',
          name: 'Tenant 2',
          database: 'tenant2'
        }
      ]
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The forRoot() method takes an options object that contains an array of tenants. The tenants array contains objects that have an id, name, and database property.

The id property is the unique identifier for the tenant. The name property is the name of the tenant. The database property is the name of the database that the tenant will use.

# How to Deploy a Multi-tenant Application

Deploying a multi-tenant application is easy. Nest.js provides a TenantModule that you can use to deploy your application to multiple tenants.

To use the TenantModule, you need to create a TenantModule for each tenant. The TenantModule contains the configuration for the tenant.

```javascript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TenantModule } from '@nestjs/tenant';

@Module({
  imports: [
    TenantModule.forRoot({
      tenants: [
        {
          id: 'tenant-1',
          name: 'Tenant 1',
          database: 'tenant1'
        },
        {
          id: 'tenant-2',
          name: 'Tenant 2',
          database: 'tenant2'
        }
      ]
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The forRoot() method takes an options object that contains an array of tenants. The tenants array contains objects that have an id, name, and database property.

The id property is the unique identifier for the tenant. The name property is the name of the tenant. The database property is the name of the database that the tenant will use.

In this post, we've learned about multi-tenant applications and how to build and deploy them with Nest.js. Multi-tenant applications have a few key advantages over traditional applications, including isolation, security, and scalability.
