# Using Nest.js with progressive enhancement

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building server-side applications. It is based on Express.js and uses TypeScript.

Nest.js is a great framework for building server-side applications. It is based on Express.js and uses TypeScript, which makes it easy to develop, maintain, and scale applications.

However, Nest.js is not without its drawbacks. One major drawback is that it does not support progressive enhancement. Progressive enhancement is a technique for building web applications that deliver an optimal experience to all users, regardless of their browser or device.

Nest.js does not support progressive enhancement because it uses server-side rendering. This means that the HTML is generated on the server and then sent to the browser. The browser then renders the HTML.

This is not a problem if the HTML is the same for all users. However, if the HTML is different for different users, then progressive enhancement is not possible.

There are workarounds for this problem, but they are not ideal. One workaround is to use a client-side framework such as Angular or React. This will allow you to use server-side rendering for the initial page load, and then use client-side rendering for subsequent page loads.

Another workaround is to use a hybrid approach, where you use server-side rendering for the initial page load, and then use client-side rendering for subsequent page loads. This approach is not ideal either, because it requires you to duplicate your codebase.

The best way to use Nest.js with progressive enhancement is to use a client-side framework such as Angular or React. This will allow you to use server-side rendering for the initial page load, and then use client-side rendering for subsequent page loads.

If you are using Nest.js with progressive enhancement, then you should consider using a client-side framework such as Angular or React.
