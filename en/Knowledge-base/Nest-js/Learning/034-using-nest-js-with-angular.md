# Using Nest.js with Angular

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and integrates with Angular.

In this post, we'll look at how to use Nest.js with Angular. We'll create a simple to-do application and cover the basics of how to use Nest.js with Angular.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few things you'll need to have in order to follow along.

First, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can find instructions for how to do this [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Next, you'll need to install the Angular CLI. You can find instructions for how to do this [here](https://cli.angular.io/).

Finally, you'll need to install the Nest.js CLI. You can find instructions for how to do this [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview).

## Creating a new Nest.js project

We'll start by creating a new Nest.js project. We can do this using the Nest.js CLI.

To create a new Nest.js project, we'll run the following command:

```
nest new project-name
```

Replace ```project-name``` with the name of your project.

This will create a new Nest.js project with the name you specified.

## Adding an Angular project

Next, we'll add an Angular project to our Nest.js project.

We can do this using the Angular CLI.

To add an Angular project, we'll run the following command:

```
ng new angular-project-name
```

Replace ```angular-project-name``` with the name of your Angular project.

This will create a new Angular project with the name you specified.

## Integrating Nest.js and Angular

Now that we have a Nest.js project and an Angular project, we need to integrate them.

We can do this by using the Nest.js CLI.

To integrate Nest.js and Angular, we'll run the following command:

```
nest g @nestjs/ng-universaluniversal-project-name
```

Replace ```universal-project-name``` with the name of your universal project.

This will generate a new universal project with the name you specified.

## Running the application

Now that we have a Nest.js project and an Angular project integrated, we can run the application.

To run the application, we'll use the Nest.js CLI.

To run the application, we'll run the following command:

```
nest start
```

This will start the application.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've looked at how to use Nest.js with Angular. We've created a simple to-do application and covered the basics of how to use Nest.js with Angular.
