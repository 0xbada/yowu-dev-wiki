# Introduction 

In this post, we will be looking at how to create services in Nest.js. Services are a great way to abstract away complex logic in your applications, and Nest.js provides a very straightforward way to create them.

We will be covering the following topics:

- What is a service?
- What are the benefits of using services?
- How to create a service in Nest.js?
- How to inject a service into a Nest.js component?
- How to use a service in a Nest.js component?

# What is a service? 

In software engineering, a service is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be accessed by other components in an application. Services are usually used to encapsulate business logic, and they can be reused across different parts of an application.

# What are the benefits of using services? 

There are many benefits to using services in your applications, including the following:

- Services can help to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Services can make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Services can improve the testability of your code.
- Services can make your code more scalable.

# How to create a service in Nest.js? 

Creating a service in Nest.js is very simple. First, create a new file in the `src/` directory and name it `my-service.service.ts`. Then, add the following code to the file:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  doSomething(): string {
    return 'Hello, world!';
  }
}
```

As you can see, we have imported the `@nestjs/common` module, which provides the `@Injectable()` decorator. We have then used this decorator to mark our `MyService` class as being injectable.

# How to inject a service into a Nest.js component? 

In order to use a service in a Nest.js component, we need to inject it into the component. Injecting a service into a component is very simple. First, we need to import the `@Inject()` decorator from the `@nestjs/common` module. Then, we can use this decorator to inject the service into the component:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MyService } from './my-service.service';

@Injectable()
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(
    @Inject(MyService)
    private readonly myService: MyService,
  ) {}
}
```

# How to use a service in a Nest.js component? 

Once a service has been injected into a component, it can be used like any other service. In the following example, we will be using the `doSomething()` method from our `MyService` service:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MyService } from './my-service.service';

@Injectable()
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(
    @Inject(MyService)
    private readonly myService: MyService,
  ) {}

  doSomething(): string {
    return this.myService.doSomething();
  }
}
```
