# Introduction

Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building server-side applications. It is based on Express.js and uses TypeScript.

Nest.js microservices are a way of structuring a Nest.js application. A microservice is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be deployed independently.

Nest.js microservices are built using the Nest.js framework and the TypeScript programming language.

# What are Nest.js microservices?

Nest.js microservices are a way of structuring a Nest.js application.

A microservice is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be deployed independently. Nest.js microservices are built using the Nest.js framework and the TypeScript programming language.

Nest.js microservices have a few benefits over a monolithic application:

- They are easier to develop and deploy
- They are easier to scale
- They are easier to test

# How to structure a Nest.js microservice

A Nest.js microservice is structured like a standard Nest.js application, with a few additions:

- A microservice has its own package.json file
- A microservice has its own tsconfig.json file
- A microservice has its own src/ directory

# How to develop a Nest.js microservice

Developing a Nest.js microservice is similar to developing a standard Nest.js application. The main difference is that you need to create a separate tsconfig.json file for the microservice.

# How to deploy a Nest.js microservice

Deploying a Nest.js microservice is similar to deploying a standard Nest.js application. The main difference is that you need to create a separate package.json file for the microservice.

# Conclusion

Nest.js microservices are a great way to structure a Nest.js application. They are easy to develop, deploy, and scale.
