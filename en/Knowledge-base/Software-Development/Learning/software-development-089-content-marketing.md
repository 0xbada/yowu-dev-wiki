# Software Development 089: Content Marketing

The internet has drastically changed the way we market and sell products. In the past, companies would rely on print advertisements, TV commercials, and radio ads to reach their target audience. 

Nowadays, content marketing is one of the most effective ways to reach your target audience. Content marketing is the process of creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. 

Content marketing is not a new concept. In fact, content marketing has been around for centuries. The term “content marketing” was first coined by John Deighton and Colleen Deighton in their 1996 article “Content Marketing: Usable Insight and Actionable Strategy” 

In the article, the Deightons defined content marketing as “the creation and distribution of relevant and valuable content to attract, acquire, and engage a clearly defined and understood target audience – with the objective of driving profitable customer action.” 

Since then, the definition of content marketing has evolved, but the core principle remains the same: create and distribute valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. 

Content marketing is an important part of any marketing strategy. It can be used to build brand awareness, generate leads, or drive sales. When used effectively, content marketing can be a powerful tool to reach your target audience. 

Here are a few tips to help you get started with content marketing:

1. Define your target audience.

2. Create valuable, relevant, and consistent content.

3. Distribute your content through various channels.

4. Measure your results.

5. Rinse and repeat.
