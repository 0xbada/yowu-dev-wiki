# Software Development 003: Programming Fundamentals

Programming is the process of designing one or more algorithms for a computer to use, and complete instructions for telling the computer what to do with those algorithms.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

## What is a high-level programming language?

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In other words, it is a programming language that is easier for humans to read, write, and maintain than a low-level language.

## What is a low-level programming language?

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from the details of the computer. In other words, it is a programming language that is difficult for humans to read, write, and maintain.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another programming language.

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that executes code written in a programming language.

## What is a programming paradigms?

A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about programming. It is a set of principles and guidelines that a programmer can use to write code.

There are four main programming paradigms:

- **Procedural programming**: A programming paradigm that focuses on writing code as a set of instructions for the computer to follow.

- **Object-oriented programming**: A programming paradigm that focuses on writing code as a set of objects that interact with each other.

- **Functional programming**: A programming paradigm that focuses on writing code as a set of functions that are called by other functions.

- **Logic programming**: A programming paradigm that focuses on writing code as a set of rules that are used to infer new information.
