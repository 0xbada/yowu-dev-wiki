# Software Development 047: Big Data and Data Science

The demand for data scientists has never been higher. With the advent of big data, companies are looking for ways to make sense of all the data they are collecting. Data science is the process of extracting knowledge from data.

Data scientists use a variety of techniques to extract knowledge from data. These techniques include machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is used to find patterns in data.

Statistical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Statistical analysis is used to find trends in data.

Data visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data. Data visualizations can be used to find patterns in data.

There are many tools available to data scientists. Some of these tools include R, Python, and Tableau.

R is a programming language that is popular among data scientists. R is used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

Python is a programming language that is popular among data scientists. Python is used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.

Tableau is a data visualization tool that is popular among data scientists. Tableau is used to create interactive data visualizations.
