# Software Development 019: Git and Version Control

## What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For example, when you are developing a piece of software, you might want to save different versions of your code as you work. Version control systems allow you to do this.

## Why Use Git?

There are many reasons to use Git for version control. Git is fast, scalable, and has a large community of users. Git is also easy to learn and has excellent documentation.

## How to Use Git

Git is a command-line tool, but there are many graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide a graphical representation of the Git workflow. We will use the command line in this tutorial, but feel free to use a GUI if you prefer.

## Installing Git

Git is available for all major operating systems. Visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) to download and install Git.

## Configuring Git

Before you can use Git, you need to configure it. Run the following command to set your username:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

Next, set your email address:

```
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address.

Finally, set your default text editor:

```
git config --global core.editor nano
```

You can replace "nano" with your preferred text editor.

## Creating a Git Repository

A Git repository is a collection of files and the history of changes to those files. You can create a new Git repository with the `git init` command.

## Cloning a Git Repository

If you want to work with an existing Git repository, you can clone it with the `git clone` command. Cloning a repository creates a local copy of the remote repository.

## Git Basics

Now that you have a Git repository, you can start working with it.

### Adding Files to the Repository

You can add files to the Git repository with the `git add` command. This command adds a file to the staging area, which is a temporary holding area for changes.

### Committing Changes

Once you have added all the files you want to commit, you can commit them to the repository with the `git commit` command. This command saves your changes to the Git history.

### Viewing the Commit History

You can view the commit history with the `git log` command. This command displays a list of all the commits in the current branch, starting with the most recent commit.

### Checking the Status of Files

You can check the status of files in the Git repository with the `git status` command. This command displays a list of all the files that have been modified since the last commit.

### Viewing Differences

You can view the differences between the current version of a file and the version in the Git repository with the `git diff` command. This command is useful for seeing what changes you have made to a file before you commit them.

## Git Branches

Git branches are used to create isolated environments for development. You can think of a branch as a separate line of development.

### Creating a Branch

You can create a new branch with the `git branch` command.

### Switching Branches

You can switch between branches with the `git checkout` command.

### Merging Branches

You can merge two branches together with the `git merge` command.

## Git Remote

Git remote is used to manage remote repositories. A remote repository is a repository that is not on your local machine.

### Adding a Remote

You can add a remote repository with the `git remote add` command.

### Fetching from a Remote

You can fetch changes from a remote repository with the `git fetch` command.

### Pushing to a Remote

You can push changes to a remote repository with the `git push` command.

## Git Tags

Git tags are used to mark specific points in the Git history. Tags are usually used to mark release points.

### Creating a Tag

You can create a tag with the `git tag` command.

### Pushing Tags

You can push tags to a remote repository with the `git push` command.

## Git Aliases

Git aliases are used to create shortcuts for Git commands.

You can create an alias with the `git config` command. For example, to create an alias for the `git status` command, you would run the following command:

```
git config --global alias.st status
```

You can now use the `git st` command to run the `git status` command.

## Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain events occur in a Git repository. Git hooks are useful for automating tasks.

Git hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory.

## Gitignore

Gitignore is used to ignore files that are not supposed to be tracked by Git. For example, you might want to ignore temporary files or log files.

You can create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your Git repository. The `.gitignore` file should contain a list of patterns to ignore.

## Git Flow

Git flow is a set of conventions for managing branches in a Git repository. Git flow is designed to make it easy to work with branches.

## GitLab

GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager. GitLab provides a web interface for managing Git repositories. GitLab also provides features for issue tracking, continuous integration, and code review.

## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. GitHub provides a web interface for managing Git repositories. GitHub also provides features for issue tracking, continuous integration, and code review.

## Bitbucket

Bitbucket is a web-based Git repository hosting service. Bitbucket provides a web interface for managing Git repositories. Bitbucket also provides features for issue tracking, continuous integration, and code review.
