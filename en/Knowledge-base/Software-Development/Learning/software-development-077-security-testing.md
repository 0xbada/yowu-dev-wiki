## What is Security Testing?

Security testing is a process of assessing the security of a computer system or application and identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious attackers.

Security testing can be conducted manually or using automated tools. Manual security testing is often used to supplement automated testing, as it can more easily find certain types of vulnerabilities, such as those that require in-depth knowledge of the system.

Automated security testing tools can scan for common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and can be run against systems frequently to help ensure that new vulnerabilities are not introduced.

## Why is Security Testing Important?

Security testing is important because it helps to find and fix vulnerabilities in systems before they can be exploited by attackers. By conducting security testing early and often, organizations can reduce the risk of being breached and can make it more difficult for attackers to successfully exploit vulnerabilities.

## Types of Security Testing

There are many different types of security testing, each with its own purpose and focus. Some of the most common types of security testing are listed below:

- **Vulnerability scanning**: Vulnerability scanning is a type of automated testing that identifies potential security vulnerabilities in systems and applications. Vulnerability scanners can be used to scan for known vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.

- **Penetration testing**: Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a type of security testing that simulates an attack on a system to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. Penetration testing can be conducted manually or using automated tools.

- **Application security testing**: Application security testing is a type of testing that assesses the security of applications. Application security testing can be conducted manually or using automated tools.

- **Web application security testing**: Web application security testing is a type of testing that assesses the security of web applications. Web application security testing can be conducted manually or using automated tools.

- **Network security testing**: Network security testing is a type of testing that assesses the security of networks. Network security testing can be conducted manually or using automated tools.

## How to Conduct Security Testing

Security testing can be conducted manually or using automated tools.

Manual security testing is often used to supplement automated testing, as it can more easily find certain types of vulnerabilities, such as those that require in-depth knowledge of the system.

Automated security testing tools can scan for common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and can be run against systems frequently to help ensure that new vulnerabilities are not introduced.

## Security Testing Tools

There are many different security testing tools available, both commercial and open source. Some of the most popular security testing tools are listed below:

- **Burp Suite**: Burp Suite is a popular commercial security testing tool that includes a web application proxy, an intruder tool, a scanner, and a repeater.

- **OWASP ZAP**: OWASP ZAP is a popular open source security testing tool that includes a web application proxy, an intruder tool, a scanner, and a repeater.

- **SQLMap**: SQLMap is a popular open source tool that automates the process of identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

- **w3af**: w3af is a popular open source web application security testing tool that automates the process of identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities.
