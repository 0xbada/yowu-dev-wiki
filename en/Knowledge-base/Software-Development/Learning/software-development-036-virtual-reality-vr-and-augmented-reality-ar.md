# Software Development 036: Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)

With the release of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, virtual reality (VR) is finally starting to become a reality for consumers. However, VR and augmented reality (AR) are not just for gamers; they have potential applications across a wide range of industries, from architecture and engineering to medicine and education.

In this post, we'll take a look at what VR and AR are, how they differ, and some of the potential applications for these technologies.

## What is Virtual Reality?

Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment that can simulate physical presence in places real or imagined. VR is typically experienced through a headset that displays images in stereoscopic 3D and provides head tracking so that the user's view of the virtual world adjusts as they move their head.

Some VR systems also use haptic feedback, which allows users to feel sensations in the virtual world. For example, you might be able to feel the texture of a virtual object or the sensation of wind blowing past you.

## What is Augmented Reality?

Augmented reality is similar to virtual reality, except that instead of being immersed in a completely artificial environment, you are still aware of and able to interact with the real world.

AR systems typically use a camera to track the user's real-world surroundings and then augment the view with computer-generated images. For example, you might use AR to see a virtual map overlayed on top of the real world, or to see virtual objects placed in your environment.

## VR vs. AR

The main difference between VR and AR is that VR is used to create a completely artificial environment, while AR is used to augment the real world.

VR is typically used for entertainment or training purposes, while AR is more often used for practical applications such as navigation or assembly instructions.

## Potential Applications

As VR and AR technology continues to develop, the potential applications for these technologies are endless. Here are just a few examples:

- **Architecture and engineering**: VR can be used to create realistic models of buildings or products. This can be used for design purposes or for training people how to use a product.

- **Medicine**: VR can be used for medical education and training, as well as for treatments such as exposure therapy for phobias or pain management.

- **Education**: VR and AR can be used to create immersive learning experiences. For example, students could use VR to explore historical environments or learn about anatomy in a virtual dissection lab.

- **Entertainment**: VR is already being used for gaming and other entertainment purposes. For example, the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are popular VR headsets for gaming.

- **Retail**: AR can be used in retail environments to provide information about products, such as pricing or reviews.

- **Industrial**: AR can be used in industrial settings for tasks such as assembly, maintenance, or repair. For example, AR could be used to provide step-by-step instructions for assembling a product.

## Conclusion

Virtual reality and augmented reality are two emerging technologies with a wide range of potential applications. These technologies are still in their early stages of development, but as they continue to evolve, the potential uses for VR and AR will only continue to grow.
