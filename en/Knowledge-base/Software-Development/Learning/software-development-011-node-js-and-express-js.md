# Software Development 011: Node.js and Express.js

In this post, we'll be looking at Node.js and Express.js, two popular tools used for software development.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. This makes it ideal for developing server-side applications.

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools for building web applications.

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. This makes it ideal for developing server-side applications.

Node.js is based on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is used in Google Chrome. Node.js also has a large ecosystem of open-source libraries that can be used for various tasks.

### Installing Node.js

Installing Node.js is a simple process. You can download the Node.js installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once the installer has been downloaded, run it and follow the instructions. Node.js will be installed on your computer.

### Running Node.js

Once Node.js has been installed, you can run JavaScript code using the Node.js runtime.

To run a JavaScript file, use the following command:

```
node {filename}
```

For example, to run a file named `hello.js`, you would use the following command:

```
node hello.js
```

Node.js will execute the code in the `hello.js` file and print the results to the console.

## Express.js

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools for building web applications.

Express.js is a popular choice for building web applications. It is easy to use and has a large community of users.

### Hello World

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" application using Express.js.

Create a file named `hello.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Hello, World! app is listening on port 3000');
});
```

This code creates an Express.js application that responds to HTTP `GET` requests with a "Hello, World!" message.

The `app.listen()` method starts the Express.js application on port 3000.

To run the application, use the following command:

```
node hello.js
```

You can now access the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've looked at Node.js and Express.js. We've seen how to install Node.js and run JavaScript code using the Node.js runtime. We've also seen how to create a simple web application using Express.js.
