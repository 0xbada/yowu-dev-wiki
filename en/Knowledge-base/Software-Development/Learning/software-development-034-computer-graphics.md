# Software Development 034: Computer Graphics

Computer graphics is the process of generating images using computers. This includes everything from 2D vector graphics to 3D models and animations.

## What is Computer Graphics?

Computer graphics is the process of generating images using computers. This includes everything from 2D vector graphics to 3D models and animations.

Computer graphics is used in a variety of fields, including:

- **Art**: Computer graphics can be used to create digital art.
- **Architecture**: Computer-aided design (CAD) software is used to create plans for buildings and other structures.
- **Education**: Computer graphics are used to create simulations and visualizations for educational purposes.
- **Engineering**: Computer graphics are used to create models and simulations for engineering purposes.
- **Film and video games**: Computer graphics are used to create the special effects you see in movies and video games.

## History of Computer Graphics

The history of computer graphics is long and fascinating. It began with the earliest computers, which were large and expensive machines used by governments and universities.

The first computer graphics were created in the 1950s. At this time, computers were used mainly for scientific and military purposes. The first computer graphics were created for these purposes as well.

One of the earliest examples of computer graphics is the 'Daisy World' simulation, created by James D. Watson and Peter T. Wetherill in 1983. This simulation was designed to model the effects of greenhouse gases on the climate.

In the 1960s and 1970s, computer graphics were used mainly for scientific and military purposes. However, as computers became smaller and more affordable, they began to be used for more personal purposes.

The first home computer, the Altair 8800, was released in 1975. This was followed by the Apple II, released in 1977. These early home computers were used mainly for games and simple applications.

The first computer-animated film, 'The Great Gatsby', was released in 1974. This film was created using a technique called 'keyframing', which is still used today.

The 1980s saw the advent of 3D computer graphics. The first 3D computer-animated film, 'Tron', was released in 1982. This was followed by the first fully 3D-rendered film, 'The Great Train Robbery', in 1984.

The 1990s saw the rise of the personal computer and the internet. This led to a boom in the computer graphics industry. Many of the most popular computer-animated films, such as 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek', were released in this decade.

Today, computer graphics are used in a wide variety of fields, from art to architecture to engineering. They are an essential part of the modern world.

## How Computer Graphics are Created

Computer graphics are created using a variety of software programs. The most common type of software used for computer graphics is called a 'raster graphics editor'.

Raster graphics editors are used to create bitmap images. Bitmap images are made up of pixels, which are tiny squares of color. Raster graphics editors are the most common type of software used for creating 2D images.

The most popular raster graphics editor is Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop is used to create everything from digital art to website designs.

Vector graphics editors are used to create vector images. Vector images are made up of paths, which are lines that can be any width or color. Vector graphics editors are used to create 2D images, 3D models, and animations.

The most popular vector graphics editor is Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator is used to create logos, illustrations, and other vector-based graphics.

3D modeling software is used to create 3D models. 3D models are made up of polygons, which are shapes that can be any size or color. 3D modeling software is used to create 3D models for use in movies, video games, and architecture.

The most popular 3D modeling software is Autodesk 3ds Max. 3ds Max is used to create 3D models for use in movies, video games, and architecture.

Animation software is used to create animations. Animations are made up of frames, which are images that are shown in sequence to create the illusion of movement. Animation software is used to create 2D and 3D animations.

The most popular animation software is Adobe After Effects. After Effects is used to create 2D and 3D animations for use in movies, video games, and television.
