# Software Development 049: Business Intelligence (BI)

The term business intelligence (BI) has become increasingly popular in recent years. BI is a broad category of application programs and technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing access to data to help enterprise users make better business decisions.

In this post, we'll take a comprehensive and practical look at BI from a software development perspective. We'll cover the following topics:

- What is business intelligence?
- The history of business intelligence
- The benefits of business intelligence
- The components of a business intelligence system
- The steps in the business intelligence process
- How to choose the right business intelligence software

## What is business intelligence?

Business intelligence (BI) is a process for turning data into information and knowledge that can be used to make better business decisions. The goal of BI is to help businesses find new opportunities, make better decisions, and optimize their operations.

BI systems are designed to support these goals by providing users with access to data, tools for analyzing that data, and ways to share their findings with others.

## The history of business intelligence

The concept of business intelligence has been around for centuries. One of the earliest examples of BI was developed in the late 1800s by Frederick Winslow Taylor, who is considered the father of scientific management. Taylor's system, known as time and motion study, involved using data to analyze and improve work processes.

In the early 1900s, another early example of BI was developed by Henri Fayol, who is considered the father of modern management. Fayol's system, known as management by objectives, also used data to improve work processes.

The modern era of BI began in the 1950s with the development of computers. This new technology made it possible to store and analyze data on a scale that was not previously possible.

In the 1960s, Edgar F. Codd, a computer scientist working for IBM, developed the relational model for database management, which is the basis for most BI systems today.

In the 1970s and 1980s, BI systems were developed for specific industries, such as healthcare and manufacturing. These systems were typically custom-built and used proprietary data formats.

In the 1990s, the first BI software applications were released. These applications were designed to work with relational databases and to be used by a wider range of users, including non-technical users.

In the 2000s, BI software became more widely adopted, and the term "business intelligence" became more common. BI software continued to evolve, with new features and capabilities being added.

Today, BI is an essential part of many businesses. It is used to make better decisions, improve operations, and find new opportunities.

## The benefits of business intelligence

There are many benefits of using BI, including:

- Improved decision making: BI provides users with access to data that can be used to make better decisions.
- Improved operations: BI can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations.
- Improved customer service: BI can be used to improve customer service by providing employees with access to data that can be used to resolve customer issues.
- New business opportunities: BI can help businesses find new opportunities for growth and expansion.

## The components of a business intelligence system

A BI system typically includes the following components:

- Data sources: BI systems need access to data. Data sources can be internal, such as databases, or external, such as market data.
- Data warehousing: BI systems typically use data warehouses to store data. Data warehouses are designed to support the needs of BI applications.
- ETL: ETL (extract, transform, load) is the process of extracting data from sources, transforming it into a format that can be used by BI applications, and loading it into a data warehouse.
- OLAP: OLAP (online analytical processing) is a type of database technology that is designed to support the needs of BI applications. OLAP databases are typically used to store data warehousing data.
- Reporting and analysis: BI systems typically include reporting and analysis tools that allow users to generate reports and perform analysis on data.
- Dashboards and visualizations: BI systems often include dashboards and visualizations that allow users to view data in a variety of ways.

## The steps in the business intelligence process

The business intelligence process typically includes the following steps:

1. Data collection: BI systems need access to data. Data can be collected from internal sources, such as databases, or external sources, such as market data.
2. Data warehousing: BI systems typically use data warehouses to store data. Data warehouses are designed to support the needs of BI applications.
3. ETL: ETL (extract, transform, load) is the process of extracting data from sources, transforming it into a format that can be used by BI applications, and loading it into a data warehouse.
4. OLAP: OLAP (online analytical processing) is a type of database technology that is designed to support the needs of BI applications. OLAP databases are typically used to store data warehousing data.
5. Reporting and analysis: BI systems typically include reporting and analysis tools that allow users to generate reports and perform analysis on data.
6. Dashboards and visualizations: BI systems often include dashboards and visualizations that allow users to view data in a variety of ways.

## How to choose the right business intelligence software

There are many BI software applications available on the market. When choosing a BI software application, it is important to consider the following factors:

- The needs of the business: The first step is to identify the needs of the business. What business decisions need to be made? What data is needed to make those decisions?
- The type of data: The next step is to identify the type of data that is needed. BI software applications typically work with relational databases. If the data is not in a relational database, it may need to be converted.
- The size of the data: The next step is to identify the size of the data. BI software applications typically work with large data sets. If the data is small, it may be possible to use a less expensive BI software application.
- The budget: The next step is to identify the budget. BI software applications can vary widely in price. It is important to choose a BI software application that is within the budget.

## Conclusion

Business intelligence (BI) is a process for turning data into information and knowledge that can be used to make better business decisions. The goal of BI is to help businesses find new opportunities, make better decisions, and optimize their operations.

BI systems are designed to support these goals by providing users with access to data, tools for analyzing that data, and ways to share their findings with others.

There are many benefits of using BI, including improved decision making, improved operations, improved customer service, and new business opportunities.

A BI system typically includes the following components: data sources, data warehousing, ETL, OLAP, reporting and analysis, and dashboards and visualizations.

The business intelligence process typically includes the following steps: data collection, data warehousing, ETL, OLAP, reporting and analysis, and dashboards and visualizations.
