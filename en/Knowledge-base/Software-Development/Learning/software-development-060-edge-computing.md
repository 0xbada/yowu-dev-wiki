# Software Development 060: Edge Computing

The term "Edge Computing" is used to describe a new class of applications and services that are built to take advantage of the unique properties of edge devices. These devices are often connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and are capable of processing data locally, without the need for a centralized server.

In many cases, edge devices are located in remote or difficult-to-reach locations. This means that they need to be able to operate independently and be able to handle failures gracefully.

Edge Computing is a new way of thinking about how we build applications and services. It allows us to move computation and data storage closer to the edge of the network, where it can be more easily accessed by end users.

There are many benefits to using Edge Computing, including:

- reduced latency
- increased security
- improved reliability
- lower costs

In this post, we'll take a look at what Edge Computing is and how it can be used to build better applications and services.

## What is Edge Computing?

Edge Computing is a new class of applications and services that are built to take advantage of the unique properties of edge devices. These devices are often connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and are capable of processing data locally, without the need for a centralized server.

- lower costs

## How can Edge Computing be used?

Edge Computing can be used in a variety of ways, depending on the needs of the application or service.

Some common use cases for Edge Computing include:

- content delivery
- image processing
- video processing
- data collection
- analytics

## What are the challenges of Edge Computing?

Edge Computing comes with a number of challenges, including:

- managing large numbers of edge devices
- ensuring quality of service
- dealing with intermittent connectivity
- managing power consumption

Despite these challenges, Edge Computing is a powerful tool that can be used to build better applications and services.

## Conclusion

Edge Computing is a new way of thinking about how we build applications and services. It allows us to move computation and data storage closer to the edge of the network, where it can be more easily accessed by end users.

There are many benefits to using Edge Computing, including:
