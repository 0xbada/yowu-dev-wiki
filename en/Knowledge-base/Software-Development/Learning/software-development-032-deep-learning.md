# Software Development 032: Deep Learning

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural networks.

## How Does Deep Learning Work?

Deep learning works by using artificial neural networks that are made up of layers of interconnected nodes. These nodes are similar to neurons in the brain and they are able to learn by adjusting the weights of the connections between the nodes.

The first layer of nodes is the input layer and this is where the data is fed into the network. The data is then passed through the hidden layers of nodes where the weights are adjusted and the data is transformed. The output layer is the final layer of nodes and this is where the transformed data is outputted.

## What are the Benefits of Deep Learning?

There are many benefits of deep learning, some of which include:

- Deep learning is able to learn from data that is unstructured or unlabeled, which means that it can be used to find patterns in data that is too complex for humans to discern.

- Deep learning is able to learn at a much faster rate than humans and can process large amounts of data quickly.

- Deep learning is able to make better predictions than humans because it is not biased by prior knowledge or experience.

## What are the Disadvantages of Deep Learning?

There are some disadvantages of deep learning, some of which include:

- Deep learning can be computationally intensive and requires a lot of data in order to learn accurately.

- Deep learning can be difficult to understand and interpret because of the complex algorithms that are used.

- Deep learning can be susceptible to overfitting, which means that it can learn the noise in the data instead of the signal.
