# Software Development 053: A/B Testing

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a web page to see which one performs better. It is a way to test changes to a website or app with a small group of users, before rolling the changes out to the entire user base.

A/B testing is also known as split testing or bucket testing.

## How Does A/B Testing Work?

A/B testing works by showing two or more versions of a web page to users at random, and then measuring which version performs better. The version that performs better is the one that is rolled out to the entire user base.

A/B testing can be used to test changes to any element on a web page, including the headline, images, button colors, and text.

## Why Use A/B Testing?

A/B testing is a valuable tool for website or app owners because it allows them to make changes to their site or app based on data, rather than guesswork.

A/B testing is also a great way to learn about your users and what they want. By testing different versions of a web page, you can learn what works best for your users, and make changes accordingly.

## How to Do A/B Testing

There are a few steps involved in setting up an A/B test:

1. Choose the element you want to test. This could be the headline, images, button colors, or text.

2. Create two or more versions of the web page, each with a different value for the element you are testing.

3. Set up a system to randomly show each version of the web page to users.

4. Measure the performance of each version of the web page. This can be done using analytics tools such as Google Analytics.

5. Choose the version of the web page that performed better, and roll it out to the entire user base.

## A/B Testing Tools

There are a number of tools that can be used to do A/B testing, including:

- Google Analytics
- Optimizely
- Visual Website Optimizer
- Convert
- Unbounce

## Conclusion

A/B testing is a valuable tool for website or app owners. It allows them to make changes to their site or app based on data, rather than guesswork. A/B testing is also a great way to learn about your users and what they want.
