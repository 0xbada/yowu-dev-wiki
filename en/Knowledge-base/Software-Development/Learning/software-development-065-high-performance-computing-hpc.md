## Software Development 065: High Performance Computing (HPC)

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a type of computing where parallel processing is used to run large-scale applications and simulations. HPC systems are usually composed of many interconnected computers that work together to complete a task.

HPC is used in many different fields, such as scientific research, engineering, weather forecasting, and finance. It can be used to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve using a single computer.

There are many different HPC architectures, but the most common are cluster systems and grid systems.

Cluster systems are made up of a group of computers, called nodes, that are connected together. Each node has its own processor and memory, and all of the nodes work together to complete a task.

Grid systems are similar to cluster systems, but they are more distributed. In a grid system, each node is connected to a central server, and the nodes can be located anywhere in the world.

HPC systems can be very expensive, and they require a lot of maintenance. They are also very complex, and can be difficult to use.

If you are interested in learning more about HPC, there are many resources available online. Here are a few of the best:
