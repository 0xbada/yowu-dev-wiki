# Software Development 022: Network Fundamentals

As a software developer, it's important to have a strong understanding of networking fundamentals. In this post, we'll cover the basics of networking, including how data is transmitted, what protocols are used, and how to troubleshoot common networking issues.

## How Data is Transmitted

Data is transmitted across networks using a variety of methods, including wired and wireless technologies. The most common type of wired technology is Ethernet, which uses cables to connect devices to the network. Wireless technologies, such as WiFi, use radio waves to transmit data.

Data is typically transmitted in packets, which are small pieces of data that are sent together. Each packet contains information about where it came from and where it's going. When a packet arrives at its destination, it is reassembled into the original data.

Packets can be lost or corrupted during transmission. To ensure that data is transmitted correctly, networks use error-checking methods, such as checksums. If a packet is lost or corrupted, it can be retransmitted.

## Network Protocols

In order for devices to communicate with each other, they must use the same protocols. Protocols are standards that define how data is transmitted. The most common protocols used on networks are TCP and UDP.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection must be established between two devices before data can be transmitted. TCP is reliable, which means that data is checked for errors and retransmitted if necessary.

UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that data can be transmitted without first establishing a connection. UDP is not as reliable as TCP, but it is faster.

## Troubleshooting Network Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to a network, there are a few things you can try.

First, check that your device is properly connected to the network. If you're using a wired connection, check that the cable is plugged in and that the lights on the network card are on. If you're using a wireless connection, check that the wireless adapter is turned on and that you're connected to the correct WiFi network.

Next, check that the network is working by trying to connect to another device on the network. If you can't connect to another device, the problem is likely with the network.

If you're still having trouble, try restarting your device and the router. If that doesn't work, you may need to contact your ISP.
