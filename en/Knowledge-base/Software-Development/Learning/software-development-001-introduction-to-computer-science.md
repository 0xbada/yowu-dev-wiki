# Software Development 001: Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to the first post in our series on software development! In this series, we'll be covering the basics of computer science and software development.

## What is Computer Science?

Computer science is the study of computers and their usage. It covers a wide range of topics, from the hardware of computers to the software that runs on them.

## What is Software Development?

Software development is the process of creating software. This can involve anything from writing code to designing user interfaces.

## What do I need to know to get started in Computer Science?

There are a few things you'll need to know before you can start studying computer science.

### 1. Basic Math

You'll need to be comfortable with basic math, as a lot of computer science concepts are based on math. This includes things like algorithms, which are a set of steps for solving a problem.

### 2. Programming Languages

You'll also need to know at least one programming language. A programming language is a way of giving instructions to a computer. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax (the rules for writing code in that language).

Some popular programming languages include:

- Java
- Python
- C++

### 3. Basic Computer Science Concepts

There are a few basic concepts you should know before getting started in computer science. These include:

- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Programming paradigms

## Where can I learn more about Computer Science?

If you want to learn more about computer science, there are a few resources you can use.

- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) offers a variety of online courses covering different computer science topics.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) has a free computer science course that covers the basics of computer science.
- [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/) has a variety of free online courses covering different computer science topics.
