Email Marketing
===============

Email marketing is a form of direct marketing that uses electronic mail as a means of communicating commercial or fundraising messages to an audience. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. However, the term is usually used to refer to:

* Sending emails with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business,
* Acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately,
* Adding advertisements to emails sent by other companies to their customers.

Email marketing is one of the most effective ways to stay in touch with your customers and keep them updated on what's happening with your business. It's also an efficient way to let them know about new products, services, or special promotions.

When done correctly, email marketing can be a powerful tool to help you grow your business. But before you start sending out emails, there are a few things you need to know.

What is an Email List?
---------------------

An email list is a list of email addresses that you have collected from people who have given you permission to send them email.

Email lists can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Sending out newsletters
* Sending out special offers
* Sending out information about new products or services

Building an email list can be a slow process, but it's worth it. The people on your email list are people who have already shown an interest in what you have to offer.

How to Build an Email List
-------------------------

There are a few different ways to build an email list:

* Collect email addresses from people who visit your website or blog. You can do this by placing a signup form on your website or blog.
* Collect email addresses from people who attend your events. You can do this by having a signup form at your events.
* Collect email addresses from people who buy your products or services. You can do this by having a signup form on your checkout page.

Once you have collected email addresses, you need to store them in a safe place. The best way to do this is to use an email marketing service.

Email Marketing Services
------------------------

Email marketing services are companies that provide email marketing tools and services. Some of the most popular email marketing services are:

* MailChimp
* AWeber
* Constant Contact
* GetResponse

Email marketing services provide a number of features that make it easy to manage your email list and send out email campaigns. Some of the features they provide are:

* Signup forms
* Email templates
* Reporting tools

How to Send an Email Campaign
-----------------------------

Once you have an email list and an email marketing service, you're ready to send out your first email campaign.

There are a few things you need to do before you send out your first email:

* Write a great subject line. The subject line is the most important part of your email. It's what will get people to open your email.
* Write great content. Your email content needs to be interesting and relevant to your audience.
* Send your email to a small group of people first. Before you send your email to your entire list, send it to a small group of people first. This will allow you to test your email and make sure everything is working.

Once you've done all of that, you're ready to send your email. Just hit the send button and your email will be on its way.

Email marketing can be a great way to grow your business. But it's important to do it right. Follow the tips in this post and you'll be on your way to email marketing success.
