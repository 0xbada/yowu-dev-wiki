# Software Development 069: Event Sourcing and CQRS

## What is Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing is an approach to software development where all changes to the state of an application are stored as a sequence of events. This sequence of events is called the event log.

## What are the benefits of Event Sourcing?

There are many benefits to using Event Sourcing, including:

- All changes to the state of the application are stored in the event log, which makes it easy to debug issues and track changes.

- The event log can be used to replay the events and recreate the state of the application, which is useful for testing and development purposes.

- Event Sourcing can be used to implement undo/redo functionality.

- The event log can be used to generate reports and analytics.

## What is CQRS?

CQRS is an approach to software development that separates the read and write operations of an application into two separate models.

## What are the benefits of CQRS?

There are many benefits to using CQRS, including:

- Read and write operations can be scaled independently, which can improve performance.

- Read and write models can be implemented using different technologies, which can improve flexibility.

- CQRS can simplify the development of complex applications.

## What is Event Sourcing + CQRS?

Event Sourcing + CQRS is an approach to software development that combines the benefits of Event Sourcing and CQRS.

## What are the benefits of Event Sourcing + CQRS?
