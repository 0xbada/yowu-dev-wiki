## Continuous Testing

Continuous testing is an important part of the software development process. It helps ensure that code changes do not break the build and that new features work as expected.

In this post, we will take a look at what continuous testing is, why it is important, and how to set it up.

### What is Continuous Testing?

Continuous testing is the process of automatically running tests against code changes. This can be done manually or using a tool like Jenkins.

The benefits of continuous testing are that it can help catch bugs early, prevent regressions, and improve code quality.

### Why is Continuous Testing Important?

Continuous testing is important because it can help catch bugs early, prevent regressions, and improve code quality.

Catching bugs early is important because it can save time and money. If a bug is found late in the development process, it can be very costly to fix.

Preventing regressions is also important. A regression is when a code change breaks something that was working before. This can be very difficult to track down and fix.

Finally, improving code quality is important because it can make the code easier to maintain and improve.

### How to Set Up Continuous Testing

There are many ways to set up continuous testing. In this section, we will take a look at two popular methods: using a tool like Jenkins, or setting up a continuous testing server.

#### Using a Tool like Jenkins

Jenkins is a popular tool for setting up continuous testing. It is open source and can be used for free.

To set up Jenkins, you will need to install it on a server. Once Jenkins is installed, you can create a job to run your tests.

Jenkins will automatically run your tests whenever code changes are made. It can also email you the results of the tests.

#### Setting Up a Continuous Testing Server

Another popular method for setting up continuous testing is to use a continuous testing server. A continuous testing server is a dedicated server that runs tests automatically.

There are many continuous testing servers available. Some popular ones are Hudson and CruiseControl.

To set up a continuous testing server, you will need to install the server software on a machine. Once the server is up and running, you can create jobs to run your tests.

The continuous testing server will automatically run your tests whenever code changes are made. It can also email you the results of the tests.

### Conclusion

Continuous testing is a vital part of the software development process. It helps ensure that code changes do not break the build and that new features work as expected.
