# Linux Interrupts and Signals

An interrupt is an event that requires the attention of the operating system kernel. When an interrupt occurs, the kernel may suspend the current process, and execute a special interrupt handler to deal with the event.

A signal is a software interrupt that is sent to a process by the kernel, or by another process. A signal may be generated by the user, such as with the kill command, or by the operating system in response to an event, such as a segmentation fault.

Interrupts and signals are similar, but have some important differences.

## Interrupts

An interrupt is generated by hardware, and causes the kernel to suspend the current process and execute a special interrupt handler.

Interrupts can be generated by the user, such as with the kill command, or by the operating system in response to an event, such as a segmentation fault.

## Signals

A signal is a software interrupt that is sent to a process. A signal may be generated by the user, such as with the kill command, or by the operating system in response to an event, such as a segmentation fault.

Signals are generated by the kernel, or by another process. When a signal is generated, the kernel may suspend the current process, and execute a special signal handler to deal with the event.

## Differences

Interrupts and signals are similar, but have some important differences:

- Interrupts are generated by hardware, while signals are generated by the kernel or another process.
- Interrupts cause the kernel to suspend the current process and execute a special interrupt handler. Signals may cause the kernel to suspend the current process and execute a special signal handler.
- Interrupts can be generated by the user, while signals can only be generated by the kernel or another process.
