# Linux Shells: bash, zsh, and more

Development work often requires the use of a shell, or command line interface. Linux has many different shells available, each with their own features and benefits. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most popular shells used on Linux, including bash, zsh, and more.

## bash

Bash is the most popular shell on Linux. It's been around for a long time and is included by default on most Linux distributions. Bash is a powerful shell with a lot of features, including job control, command line editing, and aliases.

Bash also has good support for shell scripting. Shell scripts are programs that are written in the shell language and can be run by the shell. Bash shell scripts are often used to automate tasks or create system administration tools.

## zsh

Zsh is another popular shell that's similar to bash. It includes many of the same features as bash, but also adds a few unique features of its own.

One of the most notable features of zsh is its robust tab completion. Zsh can do things like complete file paths and command options. This can be a big time saver when working on the command line.

Zsh also has a built-in history search feature. This allows you to quickly find and reuse previous commands.

## fish

Fish is a relatively new shell that's designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. It has a clean and consistent syntax that's easy to learn.

Fish also includes features like syntax highlighting and autosuggestions. These features make it easier to use the shell and can help you avoid mistakes.

Fish is a good choice for users who are new to shell scripting. It's also a good choice for users who want a more user-friendly shell.

## Other shells
