# Acceptance Criteria

## Overview
Acceptance Criteria are a set of conditions that must be met in order for a product or system to be accepted by its stakeholders. It is a way of ensuring that the product or system meets the requirements of its users and is of a high enough quality to be released. Acceptance Criteria are usually written by the product owner, and can include both functional and non-functional requirements.

## Description
Acceptance Criteria are a way of ensuring that the product or system meets the requirements of its stakeholders. They are used to evaluate the quality of the product or system and to ensure that it meets the expectations of the stakeholders. Acceptance Criteria can include both functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements are specific features or functions that must be included in the product or system. Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not related to specific features or functions, such as performance, security, or usability.

Acceptance Criteria should be written in a clear and concise manner. They should be specific, measurable, and testable. They should also be realistic and achievable. It is important to include all stakeholders in the process of writing Acceptance Criteria, as they will have different expectations and requirements for the product or system.

Acceptance Criteria should be reviewed and updated regularly, as requirements may change over time. It is also important to ensure that the Acceptance Criteria are being met throughout the development process. This can be done by using automated testing tools and manual reviews.

## Features
Acceptance Criteria can include both functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements are specific features or functions that must be included in the product or system. Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not related to specific features or functions, such as performance, security, or usability.

It is important to include all stakeholders in the process of writing Acceptance Criteria, as they will have different expectations and requirements for the product or system.

Acceptance Criteria should be reviewed and updated regularly, as requirements may change over time. It is also important to ensure that the Acceptance Criteria are being met throughout the development process. This can be done by using automated testing tools and manual reviews.

## Example
As an example, let's say you are developing a mobile app. Your Acceptance Criteria might include:

- The app must be compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 transactions per second.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 data points per second.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 API requests per second.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 notifications per second.
- The app must have a user-friendly interface.
- The app must have a secure authentication system.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 messages per second.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 images per second.
- The app must be able to handle up to 10,000 videos per second.

## Pros and Cons
The main advantage of using Acceptance Criteria is that it helps to ensure that the product or system meets the expectations of its stakeholders. It also helps to ensure that the product or system is of a high enough quality to be released.

The main disadvantage of using Acceptance Criteria is that it can be time-consuming and difficult to write. It is also important to ensure that the Acceptance Criteria are being met throughout the development process, which can be difficult to do.

## Controversy
There is some controversy surrounding the use of Acceptance Criteria. Some people argue that it is too restrictive and can stifle creativity. Others argue that it is necessary in order to ensure that the product or system meets the expectations of its stakeholders.

## Related Technology
Acceptance Criteria are closely related to other quality assurance techniques, such as automated testing and manual reviews. Automated testing is a process of running tests on a product or system in order to detect bugs or other issues. Manual reviews are a process of having an expert examine the product or system in order to detect any issues.

## Digression
Acceptance Criteria are an important part of the software development process. They are used to ensure that the product or system meets the expectations of its stakeholders and is of a high enough quality to be released. It is important to include all stakeholders in the process of writing Acceptance Criteria, as they will have different expectations and requirements for the product or system. It is also important to ensure that the Acceptance Criteria are being met throughout the development process. This can be done by using automated testing tools and manual reviews.
