# Overview
Code reuse is the practice of using existing code in new applications. It is a key element of software development, as it reduces development time and cost, and increases the quality of the code.

# Description
Code reuse is the practice of using existing code in new applications. It is a key element of software development, as it reduces development time and cost, and increases the quality of the code. Code reuse is also known as software reuse, code sharing, and code recycling.

The main types of code reuse are copy and paste reuse, library reuse, and framework reuse. Copy and paste reuse is the simplest and most common form of code reuse; it involves copying code from one application and pasting it into another. Library reuse involves using existing code libraries in new applications; these libraries are collections of code that can be used to quickly create new applications. Framework reuse involves using existing frameworks, which are collections of code and other resources that can be used to quickly create applications with a particular architecture and design.

Code reuse is beneficial because it reduces development time and cost, and increases the quality of the code. By reusing existing code, developers can focus on the unique aspects of their applications, instead of having to write code from scratch. Reusing existing code also reduces the risk of introducing bugs and other errors into the code.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantage of code reuse is that it reduces development time and cost, and increases the quality of the code. It also reduces the risk of introducing bugs and other errors into the code.

The main disadvantage of code reuse is that it can lead to code bloat, which is when code becomes overly complex and difficult to maintain. Additionally, code reuse can lead to code rigidity, which is when code is too rigid and inflexible to be easily adapted to new applications.

# Related Technology
Code reuse is closely related to object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating reusable objects. OOP encourages code reuse by allowing developers to create objects that can be used in multiple applications.

# Example
As an example of code reuse, consider a web application that displays a list of products. Instead of writing the code to display the list from scratch, the developer can use an existing code library that contains the code to display the list. This reduces development time and cost, and increases the quality of the code.
