# Overview

Elasticity is a concept that describes how a system can expand or contract to meet the needs of its users and the environment it exists within. It enables applications, services, and underlying infrastructures to adjust their size in order to better accommodate changing user demand, workloads, and other variables.

# Description

In computing, elasticity is a way to manage the scalability of applications and services. It enables organizations to adjust the size of their IT infrastructure to accommodate changing user demand, workloads, and other variables. With elasticity, organizations are able to rapidly change the size of their IT resources to match the needs of their users without having to invest in additional hardware or software.

For example, a company could use elasticity to increase the number of servers they have deployed to meet the demands of peak usage, or decrease the number of servers during periods of low demand. This allows the company to save money by not having to purchase additional hardware and software when their demand increases.

Elasticity is also important for cloud computing. In the cloud, elasticity enables organizations to quickly scale their IT resources up or down depending on their requirements. This helps organizations save money on additional hardware, software, and labor expenses as they only pay for the resources they need.

# Pros and Cons

There are several advantages to using elasticity in an IT system. It allows organizations to save money by not having to purchase additional hardware or software when their demand increases. It also helps organizations quickly scale their IT resources up or down depending on their requirements.

However, there are also some disadvantages to using elasticity in an IT system. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to manage and monitor the elasticity of a system. This can lead to problems such as over-provisioning or under-provisioning, which can have an effect on the performance of the system.
