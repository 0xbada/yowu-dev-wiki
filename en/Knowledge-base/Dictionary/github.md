# Overview
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using **Git**. It is mostly used for computer code and allows developers to keep track of changes made to the code. It is a **platform** where developers can collaborate and share their work.

# History
GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett. In 2018, it was acquired by Microsoft and is now part of the **Azure DevOps** service. 

# Description
GitHub is an online version control system that allows developers to store and share their work. With GitHub, developers can upload their code and keep track of any changes they make. This makes it easier to collaborate with other developers and to share the code with the public. 

GitHub also provides tools to help developers manage their projects. They can create **repositories**, which are collections of code, and use **branches** to create different versions of their code. They can also use **issues** to track bugs and tasks for their projects. 

Another feature of GitHub is **GitHub Pages**, which allows developers to create static websites for their projects. These websites can be used to showcase the project and provide information about it. 

# Digression
GitHub also provides a **social network** for developers. They can follow other developers and join **organizations**. They can also **star** projects and provide feedback and suggestions.
