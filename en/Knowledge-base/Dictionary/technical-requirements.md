# Overview

**Technical Requirements** are a document used to define the technical aspects of a given project, product, or application. It is used to provide a clear direction for developers and ensure that everyone involved in the project understands its technical requirements. Technical Requirements are closely related to Functional Requirements, which define the business goals and objectives of a project.

## Description

Technical Requirements are used to detail the technical aspects of a project, such as the hardware and software requirements, scalability, security, usability, and performance. It is an important document that will be used throughout the project's life cycle, from the initial planning stages through to the deployment of the final product.

The Technical Requirements should include the following: 

- **Hardware Requirements:** The hardware requirements should be detailed in the Technical Requirements document. This includes any physical hardware that is necessary for the project, such as servers, storage, networking components, and any other related hardware. 
- **Software Requirements:** The software requirements should be detailed in the Technical Requirements document. This includes any software that is necessary for the project, such as operating systems, application software, databases, and any other related software. 
- **Scalability:** The scalability of the project should be detailed in the Technical Requirements. This includes any potential scalability issues that may arise, such as the need for additional hardware or software to accommodate an increase in users or data.
- **Security:** The security of the project should be detailed in the Technical Requirements. This includes any potential security issues that may arise, such as the need for additional security measures to protect the data.
- **Usability:** The usability of the project should be detailed in the Technical Requirements. This includes any potential usability issues that may arise, such as the need for additional user interfaces or features to make the project easier to use. 
- **Performance:** The performance of the project should be detailed in the Technical Requirements. This includes any potential performance issues that may arise, such as the need for additional optimization or tuning to ensure the project runs as efficiently as possible.

## Digression

The Technical Requirements document should be written in a clear and concise manner, and should be updated on a regular basis to ensure that it reflects the current state of the project. It should also be reviewed and approved by all stakeholders before the project can proceed.
