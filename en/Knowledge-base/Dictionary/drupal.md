# Overview

Drupal is an open-source content management system (CMS) that allows individuals and organizations to create and manage websites with ease. It is written in PHP and is free to use, modify, and distribute under the GNU General Public License.

# Description

Drupal is a powerful and flexible CMS that can be used to create a wide range of websites, from simple blogs to complex e-commerce sites. It is designed to be modular, which means that you can add or remove features as needed.

Drupal is built on a system of modules, which are small pieces of code that can be added to the core system to add functionality. There are thousands of modules available for Drupal, which means that you can customize your site to your exact needs.

One of the strengths of Drupal is its flexibility. It can be used to create sites that are simple or complex, depending on your needs. For example, you can use Drupal to create a blog or a small business website, or you can use it to create a large e-commerce site with thousands of products.

Drupal is also known for its security. Because it is open-source, the code can be audited by anyone, which means that vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed quickly. Additionally, Drupal has a dedicated security team that works to identify and fix security issues.

# History

Drupal was created in 2001 by Dries Buytaert, a student at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. Buytaert originally created Drupal as a message board for his friends, but he soon realized that it had potential as a CMS.

Drupal has since grown to become one of the most popular CMSs in the world, with millions of websites running on the platform. It has also spawned a large and active community of developers, designers, and users who contribute to its development and use.

# Features

Drupal has a wide range of features that make it a powerful and flexible CMS. Some of its key features include:

- Modular architecture: Drupal's modular architecture allows you to add or remove features as needed, which makes it extremely flexible.
- Content management: Drupal makes it easy to create, edit, and publish content on your site.
- User management: Drupal allows you to create and manage user accounts, which makes it easy to control who has access to your site.
- Customizable templates: Drupal allows you to create custom templates for your site, which means that you can create a unique look and feel for your site.
- SEO-friendly: Drupal is designed to be SEO-friendly, which means that it can help your site rank higher in search engine results.
- Multilingual support: Drupal has built-in support for multiple languages, which makes it easy to create a site that is accessible to users around the world.

# Example

One example of a site that uses Drupal is the White House website. The White House website is built on Drupal and uses the platform to manage its content and user accounts.

# Pros and Cons

Like any CMS, Drupal has its pros and cons. Some of the pros of Drupal include:

- Flexibility: Drupal's modular architecture makes it extremely flexible, which means that you can customize it to your exact needs.
- Security: Drupal is known for its security, which makes it a good choice for sites that handle sensitive information.
- Large community: Drupal has a large and active community of developers, designers, and users who contribute to its development and use.

Some of the cons of Drupal include:

- Steep learning curve: Drupal can be difficult to learn, especially if you are not familiar with PHP and web development.
- Complexity: Drupal's flexibility can also be a drawback, as it can make the system complex and difficult to manage.
- Performance: Drupal can be resource-intensive, which means that it may not be the best choice for sites that have limited resources.

# Controversy

Drupal has been involved in some controversy over the years, particularly with regards to its licensing. In 2017, the Drupal community voted to adopt the GPLv2 licensing model, which caused some controversy among developers who preferred the more permissive MIT license.

Additionally, Drupal has been criticized for being difficult to learn and use, which has led some users to switch to other CMSs.

# Related Technology

Drupal is built on PHP and uses a database (usually MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store content and user data. It also uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the front-end of the site.

# Digression

One interesting aspect of Drupal is its use of hooks. Hooks are special functions that are called at specific points in the Drupal code, which allows developers to modify or extend the system's behavior.

For example, if you wanted to add a custom field to a content type in Drupal, you could use the hook_field_info() function to define the field and the hook_form_alter() function to add the field to the content type's edit form.

# Others

Drupal is a powerful and flexible CMS that can be used to create a wide range of websites. While it can be difficult to learn and use, its flexibility and security make it a good choice for many organizations. With its large and active community of developers, designers, and users, Drupal is likely to continue to be a popular choice for years to come.
