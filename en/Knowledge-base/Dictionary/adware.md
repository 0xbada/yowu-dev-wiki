# Overview
Adware is a type of malicious software (malware) that is installed on a computer without the user's knowledge. It is designed to display advertisements and collect data about the user's browsing habits for marketing purposes. Adware can also be used to track the user's online activities and collect personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

# Description
Adware is a type of malicious software that is installed on a computer without the user's knowledge. It is designed to display advertisements, often in the form of pop-up windows, while the user is browsing the web. Adware is also used to collect data about the user's browsing habits and preferences for marketing purposes. This data can then be used to target the user with advertisements that are tailored to their interests.

Adware can also be used to track the user's online activities and collect personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. This type of data can be used for identity theft or to gain access to the user's bank account. Adware is often installed as part of a free software package, such as a game or media player, and is difficult to remove without specialized software.

# History
Adware has been around since the early 2000s, when the first malicious software was developed. It was initially used as a way for software companies to generate revenue from their free software packages. However, as the technology became more sophisticated, it was used to collect data about the user's browsing habits and target them with tailored advertisements.

# Features
Adware is typically installed as part of a free software package, such as a game or media player. It is designed to display advertisements, often in the form of pop-up windows, while the user is browsing the web. Adware is also used to collect data about the user's browsing habits and preferences for marketing purposes. This data can then be used to target the user with advertisements that are tailored to their interests.

Adware can also be used to track the user's online activities and collect personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. This type of data can be used for identity theft or to gain access to the user's bank account.

# Example
One example of adware is the software package "Babylon". Babylon is a free software package that is often bundled with other software and installed on a user's computer without their knowledge. Babylon is designed to display advertisements and collect data about the user's browsing habits for marketing purposes. It is also used to track the user's online activities and collect personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

# Pros and Cons
Adware can be beneficial for software companies, as it allows them to generate revenue from their free software packages. It can also be useful for marketing purposes, as it allows companies to target users with tailored advertisements. However, adware can also be used to track the user's online activities and collect personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. This type of data can be used for identity theft or to gain access to the user's bank account.

# Controversy
Adware has been the subject of much controversy due to its potential for misuse. Critics argue that it is intrusive and unethical, as it is installed on a user's computer without their knowledge and is used to collect personal information. Furthermore, it can be difficult to remove without specialized software.

# Related Technology
Adware is related to other types of malware, such as spyware, ransomware, and viruses. Spyware is similar to adware, but is designed to collect data about the user's online activities and send it to a third party. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts the user's data and demands a ransom payment in order to unlock it. Viruses are malicious software that can spread from one computer to another and damage or delete files.

# Digression
Adware is not the only type of malicious software that can be used to collect data about the user's online activities and target them with tailored advertisements. Other types of software, such as tracking cookies and web beacons, can also be used for this purpose.

# Others
Adware can be difficult to remove without specialized software. It is important to keep the computer's operating system and antivirus software up-to-date to ensure that any malicious software is detected and removed. Furthermore, it is important to be cautious when downloading and installing software, as malicious software can be bundled with legitimate software.
