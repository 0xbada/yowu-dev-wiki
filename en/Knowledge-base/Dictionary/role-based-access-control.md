# Overview
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a type of access control system that determines what a user is allowed to do on a computer system. It assigns roles to users and restricts access to resources based on these roles. RBAC is an effective way to manage user access and simplify the management of user accounts.

# History
RBAC originated with the US Department of Defense in 1992 as a means of controlling access to sensitive information. It was subsequently adopted by many organizations and is now a widely used security measure.

# Description
RBAC is a type of access control system that limits access to resources based on user roles. It makes use of a hierarchical system of roles, with each role associated with certain privileges. A user is assigned a specific role, which grants them access to certain resources.

In RBAC, users are assigned roles that define what they are allowed to do on a system. For example, a user with the role of "administrator" would have access to all functions on the system, whereas a user with the role of "user" would have limited access.

RBAC is a powerful access control system because it allows administrators to easily manage user access. It is also beneficial because it allows for the segregation of duties, meaning that no single user can access all resources.

# Digression
RBAC is a powerful tool for managing user access, but it is not a replacement for traditional security measures. It is important to remember that RBAC does not protect against malicious users, and that other measures should be taken to ensure system security.
