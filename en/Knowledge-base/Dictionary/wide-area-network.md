# Overview
A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that spans a large geographical area, connecting multiple local area networks (LANs). WANs are typically used to connect remote sites, such as branch offices, over a large area. WANs are often used to connect LANs together, allowing users to access resources on other LANs.

# Description
A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that connects multiple local area networks (LANs) across a large geographical area. WANs are typically used to connect remote sites, such as branch offices, over a large area. WANs are often used to connect LANs together, allowing users to access resources on other LANs.

WANs are typically used to connect LANs that are geographically dispersed. WANs can be used to connect remote offices, or even entire countries. WANs are typically used to connect sites that are separated by large distances, such as hundreds or thousands of miles.

WANs are typically implemented using a variety of technologies, including leased lines, dial-up connections, digital subscriber line (DSL) connections, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connections, and virtual private networks (VPNs). Leased lines are typically used to connect sites that are close together, while dial-up connections are typically used to connect sites that are farther apart.

# History
The first WANs were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early WANs were typically used to connect mainframe computers in different locations. The first WANs used a variety of technologies, including leased lines, dial-up connections, and packet switching networks.

In the 1980s, WANs began to be used to connect personal computers. This allowed users to access resources on other computers, and to share data and applications.

In the 1990s, WANs began to be used to connect LANs that were geographically dispersed. This allowed users to access resources on other LANs, and to share data and applications across the WAN.

# Features
WANs have a variety of features that make them well-suited for connecting geographically dispersed LANs. These features include:

- High speed: WANs are typically much faster than dial-up connections and other types of connections.
- Reliability: WANs are typically more reliable than other types of connections.
- Security: WANs are typically more secure than other types of connections.
- Scalability: WANs can be easily scaled to meet the needs of the organization.

# Example
An example of a WAN is a company that has offices in multiple countries. The company can use a WAN to connect its offices in different countries, allowing users to access resources on other offices. The company can also use the WAN to share data and applications across the WAN.

# Pros and Cons
WANs have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of WANs include:

- High speed: WANs are typically much faster than dial-up connections and other types of connections.
- Reliability: WANs are typically more reliable than other types of connections.
- Security: WANs are typically more secure than other types of connections.
- Scalability: WANs can be easily scaled to meet the needs of the organization.

The disadvantages of WANs include:

- Cost: WANs can be expensive to implement and maintain.
- Complexity: WANs can be complex to configure and manage.
- Security: WANs can be vulnerable to security threats.

# Related Technology
WANs are related to other types of networks, including local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs). LANs are used to connect computers in a small area, such as an office building or a campus. MANs are used to connect computers in a larger area, such as a city or a region.

# Digression
WANs are also used to connect computers in different countries. This type of WAN is often referred to as a global area network (GAN). GANs are used to connect computers in different countries, allowing users to access resources on other countries.

# Others
WANs are used in a variety of industries, including banking, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. WANs are also used in the military, to connect military bases and installations across the world.
