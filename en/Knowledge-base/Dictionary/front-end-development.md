# Overview 
Front-end development is a web development process that involves creating and maintaining the visual aspects of a website or web application. It focuses on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website, including the website’s layout, design, and content. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build, maintain, and optimize websites and web applications.

# History 
Front-end development has been around since the beginning of the internet. The first websites were built using HTML, and the language has been continuously updated since then. CSS was introduced in the late 90s, and JavaScript was first released in 1995.

Since then, front-end development has continued to evolve with the introduction of libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, and React. These libraries and frameworks have simplified the process of web development, making it easier to create and maintain websites and web applications.
