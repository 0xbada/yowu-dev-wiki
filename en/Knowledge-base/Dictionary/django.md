# Overview
Django is an open-source web application framework written in Python. It is designed to help developers create complex, database-driven websites in a short amount of time. It is used by some of the world's most popular websites, including Instagram, Pinterest, and The Washington Post.

# Description
Django is a Python-based web framework that enables rapid development of web applications. It was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison and is maintained by the Django Software Foundation. Django is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, meaning it divides the application into three distinct layers: the model layer, which handles data; the view layer, which handles user interface design; and the controller layer, which handles the logic of the application.

Django provides a number of features that make it an ideal choice for web development. It includes an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables developers to interact with databases without writing SQL queries. It also provides a template engine that allows developers to create HTML templates with minimal effort. Furthermore, Django has an authentication system that allows developers to manage user accounts.

Django is also highly extensible. It includes a large library of third-party packages that can be used to add additional functionality to applications. Additionally, Django supports a wide range of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

# Features
* Object-relational mapper (ORM)
* Template engine
* Authentication system
* URL routing
* Internationalization
* Database support
* Third-party packages
* Security features

# Example
The following is a simple example of a Django application that displays a web page with the text "Hello World".

First, create a new Django project:

```
$ django-admin startproject hello_world
```

Next, create a new view in the `hello_world/views.py` file:

```
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World")
```

Finally, create a new URL pattern in the `hello_world/urls.py` file:

```
from django.urls import path
from .views import hello_world

urlpatterns = [
    path('', hello_world, name='hello_world'),
]
```
