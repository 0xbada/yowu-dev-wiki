## Overview
A **Content Management System** (CMS) is a web-based system that provides a suite of tools for creating and managing digital content in an organized manner. It is used to store, organize, and publish content, such as webpages, blog posts, and other digital assets.

Today, CMSs are used by businesses and individuals to manage digital content and deliver a consistent experience across multiple platforms.

## Description
A CMS is a software application that provides a suite of tools for creating, editing, storing, and managing digital content. It typically consists of a web-based user interface, a database, and a content repository. The user interface is used to create and edit content, which is then stored in the database. The content repository is used to store the content, and the CMS manages the content by organizing it into hierarchical structures, such as websites, pages, blog articles, and multimedia.

CMSs also provide a range of features, such as user authentication, version control, content approval workflow, and content search. They can also be integrated with other web-based applications, such as e-commerce platforms, social media networks, and analytics tools.
