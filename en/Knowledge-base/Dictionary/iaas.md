# Overview
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides users with virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS allows users to access and manage remote computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking without having to purchase and maintain physical hardware.

# Description
IaaS is one of the three primary categories of cloud computing services, along with Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). In IaaS, users access virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, over the internet. These resources are hosted and managed by a cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or IBM Cloud.

IaaS provides users with a wide range of benefits, including scalability, cost savings, and ease of use. By using IaaS, users can quickly and easily scale their computing resources up or down to meet their needs, without having to purchase and maintain physical hardware. This can result in significant cost savings, as users only pay for the resources they need and use. IaaS also makes it easier for users to access and manage their computing resources, as the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure.

# Features
IaaS provides users with a wide range of features, including:

- Virtualized computing resources: IaaS provides users with virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, over the internet.
- Flexible and scalable: IaaS allows users to quickly and easily scale their computing resources up or down to meet their needs.
- Cost savings: IaaS can result in significant cost savings, as users only pay for the resources they need and use.
- Ease of use: IaaS makes it easier for users to access and manage their computing resources, as the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure.
- Security: IaaS providers typically offer robust security features, such as encryption, authentication, and access control.

# Example
An example of an IaaS provider is Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS provides users with virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, over the internet. AWS also provides users with a range of features, such as scalability, cost savings, and ease of use.

# Pros and Cons
The primary benefits of IaaS are scalability, cost savings, and ease of use. By using IaaS, users can quickly and easily scale their computing resources up or down to meet their needs, without having to purchase and maintain physical hardware. This can result in significant cost savings, as users only pay for the resources they need and use. IaaS also makes it easier for users to access and manage their computing resources, as the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure.

The primary drawbacks of IaaS are security and lack of control. IaaS providers typically offer robust security features, such as encryption, authentication, and access control. However, users may not have full control over their computing resources, as the cloud provider is responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure.

# Related Technology
IaaS is related to Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). PaaS provides users with a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications. SaaS provides users with access to software applications over the internet.
