# Recovery

## Overview
Recovery is the process of restoring data or systems to their previous state after an unexpected event or failure. IT recovery is a critical aspect of business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning. 

## Description
Recovery is essential for businesses that rely on technology to operate. It is the process of restoring data or systems to their previous state after an unexpected event or failure. This could be anything from a power outage to a cyber attack. The goal of recovery is to minimize the impact of the incident on the business and ensure that operations can resume as quickly as possible.

There are several types of recovery, including:

### Data Recovery
Data recovery is the process of restoring lost, damaged, or corrupted data. This can be done through the use of backup and recovery software, which creates copies of data and stores them in a safe location. In the event of data loss or corruption, the backup can be used to restore the data to its previous state.

### System Recovery
System recovery is the process of restoring a computer system to its previous state after a failure or error. This can be done through the use of system restore points, which are snapshots of the system taken at specific points in time. If a system failure occurs, the system can be restored to a previous restore point to get it back up and running.

### Disaster Recovery
Disaster recovery is the process of restoring IT systems and infrastructure after a major disaster, such as a natural disaster or cyber attack. This involves a comprehensive plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a disaster, including backup and recovery procedures, communication plans, and alternative work locations.

## Features
Recovery is a critical aspect of business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning. It ensures that businesses can continue to operate in the event of an unexpected event or failure. Some key features of recovery include:

### Backup and Recovery
Backup and recovery software is essential for data recovery. It creates copies of data and stores them in a safe location, ensuring that they can be restored in the event of data loss or corruption.

### System Restore Points
System restore points are snapshots of a computer system taken at specific points in time. They can be used to restore the system to a previous state in the event of a failure or error.

### Disaster Recovery Planning
Disaster recovery planning involves creating a comprehensive plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a major disaster. This includes backup and recovery procedures, communication plans, and alternative work locations.

## Example
A common example of recovery is the use of backup and recovery software to restore lost or corrupted data. For example, if a company's financial records are lost due to a hardware failure, the backup and recovery software can be used to restore the data from a previous backup.

Another example is the use of system restore points to restore a computer system to a previous state. For example, if a software update causes a computer to crash, a system restore point can be used to restore the system to a previous state before the update was installed.

## Pros and Cons
The pros of recovery include:

- Ensures that businesses can continue to operate in the event of an unexpected event or failure
- Reduces the impact of incidents on the business
- Provides peace of mind to business owners and stakeholders

The cons of recovery include:

- Can be time-consuming and expensive to implement
- May require specialized knowledge and expertise
- May not be effective in all situations

## Controversy
There is little controversy surrounding recovery, as it is widely accepted as a critical aspect of business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning.

## Related Technology
Recovery is closely related to backup and recovery software, system restore points, and disaster recovery planning. Other related technologies include data replication, which involves copying data from one location to another in real-time, and virtualization, which allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.

## Digression
Recovery is just one aspect of business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning. Other important aspects include risk assessment, business impact analysis, and incident response planning.

## Others
Overall, recovery is a critical aspect of IT development and business continuity planning. It ensures that businesses can continue to operate in the event of an unexpected event or failure, reducing the impact of incidents on the business and providing peace of mind to business owners and stakeholders.
