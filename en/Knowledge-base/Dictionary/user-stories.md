# User Stories

## Overview
User Stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. They are used in Agile software development to capture the requirements of the customer.

## Description
User Stories are written in the form of a sentence or a few sentences in the everyday language of the user. They are written in the first person and focus on the user's needs and goals. User Stories should be concise, clear, and easily understood by all stakeholders.

User Stories are used to capture what a user wants from a system, and should be written from the user's perspective. They should include the user's goals, the expected outcome, and any constraints or limitations. User Stories should also include acceptance criteria, which are the conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete.

User Stories are written during the planning phase of an Agile project. They are used to define the product's requirements and to help the team understand what needs to be built. User Stories are then broken down into tasks and assigned to individual team members.

## Example
As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history so that I can see what I have purchased.

Acceptance criteria:
- The customer should be able to view their order history
- The order history should include details such as the date of purchase, the product purchased, and the price

## Pros and Cons
Pros:
- User Stories are easy to understand and can be understood by all stakeholders
- They focus on the user's needs and goals
- They can be broken down into tasks and assigned to individual team members

Cons:
- User Stories may be too vague or too detailed
- It can be difficult to capture all of the user's needs in a single story
- Acceptance criteria can be difficult to define

## Related Technology
User Stories are closely related to other Agile development techniques such as Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). ATDD and BDD are both techniques that use automated tests to validate the requirements of a User Story.
