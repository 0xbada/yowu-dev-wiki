# Overview

Threat modeling is an important process for IT development, used to identify and address security risks. It is used to identify threats and vulnerabilities in a system or application, and to identify the best strategies for protecting it. Threat modeling helps to create a secure environment by helping to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, and then mitigating them.

# History

Threat modeling has been around since the early 2000s, but it has become increasingly important in recent years, as IT security has become more important. In 2006, Microsoft released the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, which is based on the STRIDE model. The STRIDE model is a framework for threat modeling, developed by Microsoft to help organizations identify and address security risks.

# Description

Threat modeling is a process for assessing security risks in a system or application. It involves reviewing the system or application and identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. The goal of threat modeling is to identify and mitigate potential security risks before they can be exploited.

Threat modeling is typically done in three steps. First, the system or application is reviewed and potential threats and vulnerabilities are identified. This step is usually done using a framework such as the STRIDE model. Second, the potential threats and vulnerabilities are evaluated and prioritized. Finally, a strategy for mitigating the threats and vulnerabilities is developed.

# Digression

The STRIDE model is a popular framework for threat modeling. It is a six-step process that helps to identify and address security risks. The six steps of the STRIDE model are as follows:

1. **Spoofing**: Identifying potential threats that involve impersonation or deception.
2. **Tampering**: Identifying potential threats that involve altering or manipulating data.
3. **Repudiation**: Identifying potential threats that involve denying access to resources or denying an action.
4. **Information Disclosure**: Identifying potential threats that involve unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
5. **Denial of Service**: Identifying potential threats that involve preventing authorized users from accessing resources or services.
6. **Elevation of Privilege**: Identifying potential threats that involve unauthorized access to resources or services.
