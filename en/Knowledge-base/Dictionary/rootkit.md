# Overview
A rootkit is a type of malicious software that conceals itself and other malicious activity on a computer system. Rootkits can be used to gain access to sensitive data, hijack system resources, and allow attackers to remotely control the system. Rootkits are often difficult to detect and can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the system and its applications.

# History
Rootkits have been around since the late 1990s and were first used by computer hackers to gain access to systems for malicious purposes. The first rootkits were used to gain access to Unix systems, but they have since been used on Windows and Mac OS X systems as well.

# Description
A rootkit is a type of malicious software that is designed to hide other malicious activity on a computer system. Rootkits are typically installed on a system without the user’s knowledge and can be used to gain access to sensitive data, hijack system resources, and allow attackers to remotely control the system. Rootkits can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the system and its applications, allowing attackers to gain access to systems and data that would otherwise be inaccessible.

Rootkits can be difficult to detect, as they are designed to conceal their presence on the system. Rootkits can be used to hide files, processes, and other malicious activity from antivirus and security software. Additionally, rootkits can be used to disable security features, such as firewalls and software updates, which can make it easier for attackers to gain access to the system.

# Digression
The most common types of rootkits are kernel-level rootkits and user-mode rootkits. Kernel-level rootkits are installed on the kernel of the operating system, which allows them to gain access to the core of the system. User-mode rootkits are installed on user-level applications, such as web browsers and email clients, which allows them to gain access to the user’s data and system resources.

Rootkits can be used to gain access to sensitive data, such as passwords, financial information, and personal data. They can also be used to hijack system resources, such as CPU and memory, which can be used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or other malicious activities. Additionally, rootkits can be used to allow attackers to remotely control the system, which can be used to install additional malware or spyware.
