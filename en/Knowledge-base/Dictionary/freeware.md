# Overview
Freeware is a type of computer software that is available for use at no cost or for an optional fee. It is typically distributed without source code and is usually created by an individual or a small group of developers. Freeware is often used to provide a basic level of functionality to users who may not be able to afford more expensive software.

# History
The term "freeware" was first used in the early 1980s to describe software that was made available for free. Initially, this software was distributed on floppy disks and was often created by hobbyists who wanted to share their work with others.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the internet became more widely available and freeware began to be distributed online. This allowed developers to reach a much larger audience and allowed users to download software without having to purchase physical media.
