# Overview
Object code is a type of low-level computer programming language that is the result of a compilation process. It is the final version of a program after it is converted from a high-level language, like Java or C++, into a language that the computer can understand. Object code is also known as machine code, binary code, and machine language.

# History
Object code was developed in the 1950s, when computers began to become more widely used. As computers became more powerful, the need to create more complex programs that could run on these machines increased. This led to the development of high-level programming languages, like Java and C++, which allowed programmers to write code that was easier to read and understand. However, these programs had to be converted into object code in order for the computer to be able to understand and execute them.

# Description
Object code is the output of a compilation process, which is the process of converting a high-level language into a language that the computer can understand. This process is done by a compiler, which is a program that takes a program written in a high-level language and converts it into a series of instructions that the computer can execute. The resulting object code is a series of 0s and 1s that represent instructions for the computer.

Object code is also known as machine code, binary code, and machine language. It is the lowest level of programming language, meaning that it is the closest to the language that the computer actually understands. It is not meant to be read by humans, as it is difficult to understand, and is usually only used by experienced programmers.

# Digression
Object code can also be used to create executable files, which are files that can be run on a computer. These files are usually created by combining object code with other files, like data files and libraries. Executable files are the final step in the process of creating a program, as they are the files that the computer can actually execute.
