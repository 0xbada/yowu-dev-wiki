# Overview
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is a set of techniques and processes used to analyze and manage a company’s projects and resources. It is designed to help organizations prioritize, allocate, and manage their resources to achieve their strategic objectives. It is also used to identify, evaluate, and select projects that are best suited to the organization’s goals.

# Description
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is an important tool for organizations of all sizes, as it helps them to plan, prioritize, and manage their resources in a more efficient and effective manner. It is typically used to identify, evaluate, and select projects that are best suited to the organization’s goals and objectives.

PPM involves a variety of processes and techniques, such as project selection and prioritization, resource allocation, and project tracking and monitoring. It is important to note that PPM is not just about selecting and prioritizing projects; it also involves managing resources, such as personnel and financial resources, to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget.

PPM is typically implemented using software tools and processes. These tools help to automate the process of project selection, resource allocation, and project tracking and monitoring. The software tools can also be used to generate reports and to track the progress of projects.
