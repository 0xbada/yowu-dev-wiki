# Overview
Subnetting is a process of dividing a network into smaller networks, called subnets. It is used to improve network performance, security, and scalability. Subnetting is a key component of network design and is used in both local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs).

# History
Subnetting was first introduced in the early 1980s as a way to improve the performance of large networks. It was initially used to divide large networks into smaller, more manageable networks. Over time, subnetting has become an essential part of network design and is used in both LANs and WANs.

# Description
Subnetting is a process of dividing a network into smaller networks, called subnets. Each subnet is a separate network with its own set of IP addresses. Subnets are connected to each other through routers.

Subnetting is used to improve network performance, security, and scalability. By dividing a network into smaller subnets, it is easier to manage and troubleshoot the network. It also improves security by isolating different parts of the network from each other. Finally, it improves scalability by allowing the network to grow without having to reconfigure the entire network.

# Example
For example, consider a network with a single IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24. This network can be divided into two subnets, 192.168.1.0/25 and 192.168.1.128/25. The first subnet will have IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.127, and the second subnet will have IP addresses from 192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.255.

# Pros and Cons
Subnetting has several advantages. It improves network performance, security, and scalability. It also makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot the network.

However, subnetting can also be complex and time-consuming. It requires careful planning and configuration to ensure that the subnets are properly configured and that the network is secure.
