# Project Review

## Overview
A project review is a process of evaluating a project's progress, results, and effectiveness. It is typically conducted by a team of experts and stakeholders who assess the project's performance and suggest improvements. The review process is usually divided into two stages: initial review and final review. The initial review assesses the project's progress and identifies areas of improvement, while the final review evaluates the project's results and determines whether the project was successful.
