**#Accessibility Testing**

Accessibility testing is the process of testing an application or website to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities. It is an important part of software development and quality assurance.

##Overview

Accessibility testing is a type of usability testing that focuses on making sure an application or website is usable by people with disabilities. It involves testing the user interface, content, and design of a product to ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities such as visual impairments, hearing impairments, motor impairments, and cognitive impairments.

Accessibility testing typically includes a range of activities such as manual testing, automated testing, and code reviews. It also includes usability testing, which involves testing the user experience of a product to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities.

##History

Accessibility testing has been around for many years, but it has become more important in recent years as the number of people with disabilities has increased. The World Health Organization estimates that 15% of the worldâ€™s population has some form of disability.

In 2018, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which legally binds countries to promote the full inclusion of people with disabilities in society. This has led to the development of accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, which provides detailed guidelines for making websites and web content accessible to people with disabilities.

##Description

Accessibility testing is a process that focuses on making sure an application or website is usable by people with disabilities. It usually involves manual testing and automated testing, as well as code reviews.

Manual testing involves testing the user interface and content of a product to make sure it is accessible to people with disabilities. This includes testing for keyboard accessibility, screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and other accessibility features.

Automated testing involves testing the code of a product to make sure it meets accessibility standards. This includes testing for valid HTML and CSS, as well as checking for compliance with accessibility guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

Code reviews involve reviewing the code of a product to make sure it meets accessibility standards. This includes checking for valid HTML and CSS, as well as checking for compliance with accessibility guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

##Digression

In addition to manual testing, automated testing, and code reviews, accessibility testing also involves usability testing, which involves testing the user experience of a product to make sure it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes testing for keyboard accessibility, screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and other accessibility features.
