# Overview
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves regularly merging code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. This process helps ensure that the codebase is in a working state and free from errors. CI also increases the speed of development and helps teams identify, detect, and fix bugs quickly. 

# Description
Continuous integration is a process that involves frequently merging code changes from multiple developers and other contributors in a shared repository. This helps ensure that all contributors are working on the same version of the codebase, and that the code is in a working state. CI is typically used in agile software development and is often combined with automated testing and code review processes.

The process of continuous integration begins when a developer pushes code changes to a shared repository. This triggers an automated build process, which checks the code for errors and conflicts with existing code. If no errors are found, the build process then runs automated tests to verify that the code is working correctly. If the tests fail, the process stops, and the developer is alerted. If the tests pass, the process continues, and the code changes are merged into the shared codebase.

CI can help reduce the time and effort required to develop software. By ensuring that code changes are regularly merged and tested, teams can quickly identify, detect, and fix bugs before they become an issue. This helps teams stay agile, reduce the time needed for development, and improve the quality of the product.

# Digression
Continuous integration can be implemented in different ways, depending on the needs of the team and the development environment. Common methods include using **continuous integration tools** such as Jenkins or Travis CI. These tools are designed to automate the build process, run tests, and merge code changes from multiple contributors. 

Additionally, teams can use **version control systems** such as Git or Subversion to keep track of code changes. Version control systems track changes over time, allowing teams to easily review and compare different versions of the codebase. This makes it easy to identify, detect, and fix bugs.
