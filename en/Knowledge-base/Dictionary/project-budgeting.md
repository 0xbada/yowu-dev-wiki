## Description

Project budgeting is the process of forecasting and allocating the costs of a project before it's completed. It involves estimating expenses, creating budgets, setting goals, and tracking progress. The goal of project budgeting is to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.

Project budgeting begins with an estimate of the costs of the project. This estimate is based on the project's scope, timeline, and resources. The project manager then creates a budget, which is a document that outlines the expected costs of the project. The budget is used to track actual expenses and compare them to the estimated costs.

Project budgeting also involves setting goals for the project. These goals help the project manager measure the project's progress and determine if it is on track to be completed on time and on budget. Goals can include cost and timeline goals, as well as goals related to the quality of the project's deliverables.

Finally, project budgeting involves tracking expenses. This includes collecting data on actual costs and comparing them to the budget. This helps the project manager identify potential issues and adjust the budget as needed.

## Digression

Project budgeting is a critical part of successful project management. It helps the project manager ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. It also helps identify potential issues and adjust the budget as needed.

Project budgeting is a dynamic process that should be regularly monitored. As the project progresses, the project manager should review and adjust the budget as needed. This helps ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.
