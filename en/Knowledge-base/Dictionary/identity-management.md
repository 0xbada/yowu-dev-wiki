# Overview
Identity management (IdM) is a system of processes and technologies used to manage digital identities. It is used to authenticate and authorize users, as well as to protect the security of an organization's data and resources. Identity management is an important part of any organization's security strategy, as it helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.

# History
Identity management has been around since the early days of computing. In the 1970s, the first identity management systems were developed to manage user accounts and passwords. These systems were used to authenticate users and authorize access to resources.

In the 1990s, the concept of identity management was expanded to include the management of digital identities. This included the use of digital certificates, public key infrastructure (PKI), and single sign-on (SSO) technologies.

# Description
Identity management is a system of processes and technologies used to manage digital identities. It is used to authenticate and authorize users, as well as to protect the security of an organization's data and resources.

Identity management systems are used to create, store, and manage digital identities. These systems can be used to authenticate users, authorize access to resources, and protect the security of an organization's data and resources.

Identity management systems can also be used to manage user accounts and passwords, as well as to manage digital certificates, public key infrastructure (PKI), and single sign-on (SSO) technologies.

# Example
For example, an identity management system can be used to authenticate users and authorize access to resources. The system can be used to create user accounts and passwords, as well as to manage digital certificates, public key infrastructure (PKI), and single sign-on (SSO) technologies.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantage of identity management is that it helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information. It also helps to protect the security of an organization's data and resources.

The main disadvantage of identity management is that it can be difficult to implement and maintain. It also requires a significant amount of resources and expertise to manage.
