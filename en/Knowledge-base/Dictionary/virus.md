# Overview
A virus is a type of malicious software that can be used to disrupt the normal functioning of a computer, network or other electronic system. Viruses are typically spread from computer to computer via email or other electronic communication platforms. They can also be spread through malicious software downloads or through the use of infected removable storage devices such as USB drives or memory cards. 

The primary goal of a virus is to spread itself as widely as possible. Once a virus is installed onto a computer or other system, it can cause damage to software, hardware, data or files. It can also be used to steal information or spy on users of the target system.

# History
Viruses have been around since at least the 1980s and their development has continued to this day. The first known computer virus was created in 1986 by two Pakistani brothers, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi. The virus, called the Brain virus, was designed to spread itself through floppy disks and targeted the Microsoft DOS operating system. 

Since then, viruses have become increasingly sophisticated and have been used for a variety of malicious purposes. In the 1990s, viruses began to spread through email attachments and in the 2000s, they began to spread through malicious websites and malicious downloads. 

# Description
A virus is a piece of software code that has been designed to replicate itself and spread from one computer or device to another. It can be spread via email, malicious software downloads, or by using an infected removable storage device such as a USB drive or memory card. 

When a virus is installed onto a device, it can cause damage to software, hardware, data or files. It can also be used to steal information or spy on users of the target system.

# Example
One example of a virus is the WannaCry ransomware virus, which was first discovered in May 2017. WannaCry infected over 200,000 computers in over 150 countries, encrypting data and demanding a ransom payment in exchange for its release. 

The virus was spread through email attachments and malicious downloads, and was particularly successful due to its ability to self-replicate and spread quickly.

# Pros and Cons
The primary benefit of a virus is that it can be used to spread malicious software quickly and easily. However, this also makes it a threat to computer systems and users, as it can cause significant damage to software, hardware and data. 

The use of a virus also poses a security risk, as it can be used to spy on users and steal sensitive information. As such, it is important to use an up-to-date anti-virus software to protect your system from infection.
