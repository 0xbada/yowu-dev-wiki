# Overview
Organizational culture is the shared values, beliefs, and norms that characterize an organization and guide the behavior of its members. It is the way people think, feel, and act in the workplace, and it affects how they interact with each other, customers, and other stakeholders.

# Description
Organizational culture is an important factor in the success of any organization. It sets the tone for how employees interact with each other and how they approach their work. It can also impact the quality of products and services, customer satisfaction, employee morale, and overall organizational performance.

Organizational cultures can be classified into several types, such as hierarchical, collaborative, and innovative. Hierarchical cultures are characterized by a top-down structure, with clear roles and responsibilities. Collaborative cultures emphasize teamwork and cooperation. Innovative cultures are focused on creativity and taking risks.

Organizational culture is shaped by the organizationâ€™s history, values, and goals. It is also influenced by the people who work in the organization, their backgrounds, and their beliefs.
