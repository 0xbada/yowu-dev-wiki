# Overview
A framework is a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that provide a foundation for developing software applications. It is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to quickly build applications. Frameworks are used to create applications that are easier to maintain and have fewer bugs.

# History
The concept of a framework has been around since the early days of software development. In the early days, frameworks were used to create applications that were easier to maintain and had fewer bugs. Over time, frameworks have evolved to become more powerful and easier to use.

# Description
A framework is a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that provide a foundation for developing software applications. It is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to quickly build applications. Frameworks are used to create applications that are easier to maintain and have fewer bugs.

Frameworks provide a structure for developers to follow when creating applications. This structure helps developers to create applications that are consistent and maintainable. It also helps to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written, as many of the common tasks have already been taken care of.

Frameworks can be divided into two main categories: server-side frameworks and client-side frameworks. Server-side frameworks are used to create web applications that run on a web server. Examples of server-side frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET. Client-side frameworks are used to create web applications that run in the user's browser. Examples of client-side frameworks include Angular, React, and Vue.

# Digression
Frameworks can also be divided into two other categories: full-stack frameworks and micro-frameworks. Full-stack frameworks provide a complete set of tools for developing web applications. They typically include a web server, a database, and a templating engine. Examples of full-stack frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET. Micro-frameworks are lightweight frameworks that provide a minimal set of tools for developing web applications. Examples of micro-frameworks include Flask, Sinatra, and Bottle.
