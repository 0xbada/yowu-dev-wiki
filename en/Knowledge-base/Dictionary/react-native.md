# Overview
React Native is a JavaScript framework for building mobile applications for iOS and Android. It was developed by Facebook and is used by companies such as Walmart, Instagram, and Skype.

# Description
React Native is a JavaScript framework that enables developers to create native mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms. It uses a combination of JavaScript and XML-like markup (JSX) to create user interfaces. React Native also allows developers to create native components for both platforms, giving developers the ability to create applications with a native look and feel.

React Native uses the same design as React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allows developers to quickly create applications that are cross-platform compatible. React Native also supports the use of third-party libraries, allowing developers to easily add features to their applications.

React Native also supports the use of native code, allowing developers to write code in Objective-C, Java, or Swift for native iOS and Android applications. This allows developers to create applications with a more native look and feel.

# History
