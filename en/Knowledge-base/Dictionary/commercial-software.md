# Overview
Commercial software is any software that is developed for sale or other forms of compensation. It is usually developed by an individual or a company, and is usually sold to the public, either directly or through a third-party distributor. It is often contrasted with open-source software, which is software that is developed freely and openly available to the public.

# Description
Commercial software is typically developed with the intention of making a profit. It is usually created by a company or individual and is sold to the public either directly or through a third-party distributor. The software is usually protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws, which prevents it from being copied or redistributed without the permission of the copyright holder.

Commercial software is often contrasted with open-source software, which is software that is developed freely and openly available to the public. Open-source software is usually distributed under a license that allows anyone to use, modify, and redistribute the software for free.

Commercial software can range from simple programs to complex enterprise applications. It can come in the form of a single program, a suite of programs, or a service. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as office productivity, gaming, graphics design, and web development.

# History
The first commercial software was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At that time, software was still relatively new and was typically developed in-house by organizations. However, companies began to realize the potential of selling software to the public, and the first commercial software products began to appear.

The 1980s saw the rise of the personal computer, and with it, the growth of the commercial software industry. Companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Symantec, and Corel began to dominate the market, and software became an increasingly important part of the economy.

# Features
Commercial software typically has several features that set it apart from open-source software. These features include:

- Professional Support: Commercial software is typically backed by a team of professionals who can provide technical support and assistance.
- Quality Assurance: Commercial software is usually tested and validated before being released to the public, ensuring a high level of quality.
- Security: Commercial software is usually more secure than open-source software, as it is typically developed with security in mind.
- Licensing: Commercial software is usually protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws, which prevents it from being copied or redistributed without the permission of the copyright holder.

# Example
Microsoft Office is one of the most popular commercial software products. It is a suite of office productivity tools, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. It is sold directly to the public and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantage of commercial software is that it is typically of higher quality than open-source software, as it is developed with quality assurance in mind. It also typically has better support and security than open-source software. The main disadvantage is that it is usually more expensive than open-source software.

# Controversy
The commercial software industry has been criticized for its high prices and restrictive licensing. Some people argue that software should be freely available to everyone, while others argue that software should be protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws in order to incentivize innovation.

# Related Technology
Commercial software is often related to other forms of software, such as open-source software, freeware, and shareware. Open-source software is software that is developed freely and openly available to the public. Freeware is software that is distributed without cost, but may still be subject to copyright and other intellectual property laws. Shareware is software that is distributed on a trial basis, with the expectation that the user will purchase a license if they decide to continue using the software.

# Digression
The commercial software industry has been an important part of the economy for decades. It has helped to create jobs and generate revenue for companies, and it has enabled the development of many innovative products.
