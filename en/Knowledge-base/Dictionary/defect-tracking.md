# Overview
Defect tracking is a process used by software development teams to identify, document, and resolve software bugs. It is an essential part of the software development process, as it helps to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets customer expectations. Defect tracking can be used to identify and fix issues before they become major problems, as well as to track the progress of bug fixes.

# History
The concept of defect tracking has been around since the early days of software development. In the early days, software developers would manually track bugs, often using paper-based systems. As software development became more complex, more sophisticated defect tracking systems were developed. In the 1980s, the first commercial defect tracking systems were developed, and in the 1990s, the first web-based defect tracking systems were introduced.

# Description
Defect tracking is a process used to identify, document, and resolve software bugs. It is an essential part of the software development process, as it helps to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets customer expectations. Defect tracking can be used to identify and fix issues before they become major problems, as well as to track the progress of bug fixes.

Defect tracking systems are typically used to record and track software bugs. They are used to document the details of a bug, such as the date it was discovered, the severity of the bug, and the steps taken to fix it. The systems also allow developers to assign tasks to other team members, and to track the progress of bug fixes.

# Features
Defect tracking systems typically have the following features:

- Issue tracking: This feature allows developers to track and document bugs, as well as to assign tasks to other team members.

- Bug reporting: This feature allows developers to report bugs to the defect tracking system.

- Bug resolution: This feature allows developers to track the progress of bug fixes, as well as to assign tasks to other team members.

- Version control: This feature allows developers to track changes to the software, as well as to roll back changes if necessary.

- Automated testing: This feature allows developers to run automated tests to ensure the software is functioning correctly.

# Example
An example of a defect tracking system is JIRA. JIRA is a popular defect tracking system used by many software development teams. It allows developers to track and document bugs, assign tasks to other team members, and track the progress of bug fixes. It also has features for version control, automated testing, and bug reporting.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantages of defect tracking systems are that they help to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets customer expectations. They also help to identify and fix issues before they become major problems, as well as to track the progress of bug fixes.

The main disadvantage of defect tracking systems is that they can be time-consuming and expensive to set up and maintain. Additionally, they require a certain level of technical expertise to use effectively.

# Related Technology
Defect tracking systems are related to other software development tools, such as version control systems, automated testing tools, and bug tracking systems. Version control systems allow developers to track changes to the software, while automated testing tools allow developers to run automated tests to ensure the software is functioning correctly. Bug tracking systems allow developers to report bugs to the defect tracking system.

# Digression
Defect tracking systems are an essential part of the software development process, as they help to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets customer expectations. They are also an important tool for identifying and fixing issues before they become major problems, as well as for tracking the progress of bug fixes.
