# Overview
Federation is a type of network architecture that enables the sharing of resources between different organizations or different parts of the same organization. It is most commonly used in enterprise IT environments, where organizations need to share data, applications, and services across different networks.

# Description
Federation is a type of network architecture that allows for the sharing of resources between different organizations or different parts of the same organization. It is based on the principle of trust, in which each organization or part of a single organization has access to the resources of another organization, without having to share the same physical network. This type of architecture is most commonly used in enterprise IT environments, where organizations need to share data, applications, and services across different networks.

Federation can be implemented in two ways: through a centralized architecture, or through a decentralized architecture. In a centralized architecture, a single organization is responsible for the management and control of all the resources in the network. In a decentralized architecture, each organization or part of a single organization is responsible for managing and controlling its own resources.

Federation is often used in combination with other technologies, such as virtualization and cloud computing, to enable organizations to share resources more efficiently. It also provides organizations with a high degree of flexibility, as they can easily scale up or down depending on their needs.

# History
The concept of federation has its origins in the early days of computer networking, when organizations needed to share resources across different networks. In the late 1990s, the concept was formalized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which developed a set of protocols and standards for federated networks.

In the early 2000s, federation was adopted by many organizations as a way to share resources across different networks. It was also used to enable organizations to securely access resources from other organizations, without having to share the same physical network.

# Features
Federation is a type of network architecture that enables the sharing of resources between different organizations or different parts of the same organization. It is based on the principle of trust, in which each organization or part of a single organization has access to the resources of another organization, without having to share the same physical network.

Federation can be implemented in two ways: through a centralized architecture, or through a decentralized architecture. In a centralized architecture, a single organization is responsible for the management and control of all the resources in the network. In a decentralized architecture, each organization or part of a single organization is responsible for managing and controlling its own resources.

Federation also provides organizations with a high degree of flexibility, as they can easily scale up or down depending on their needs. It also enables organizations to securely access resources from other organizations, without having to share the same physical network.

# Example
An example of a federated network is a university network, where each department has its own network, but all the departments are connected through a single network. In this case, each department has access to the resources of other departments, without having to share the same physical network.

# Pros and Cons
Federation provides organizations with a high degree of flexibility, as they can easily scale up or down depending on their needs. It also enables organizations to securely access resources from other organizations, without having to share the same physical network.

However, federation can be complex to implement and manage, as there is a need to maintain trust between different organizations or parts of the same organization. It can also be difficult to ensure that the resources being shared are secure and up-to-date.

# Controversy
Federation has been criticized by some as a form of "data colonialism," in which organizations with more resources are able to access the resources of organizations with fewer resources. This has led to some organizations refusing to participate in federated networks, in order to protect their data from being accessed by larger organizations.

# Related Technology
Federation is often used in combination with other technologies, such as virtualization and cloud computing, to enable organizations to share resources more efficiently. It is also related to other network architectures, such as peer-to-peer networks and distributed networks.

# Digression
Federation is often confused with the concept of federation in the political context, where it refers to the unification of different political entities into a single state. This is a completely different concept, and should not be confused with the concept of federation in the IT context.

# Others
Federation is an important concept in the IT world, as it enables organizations to securely share resources across different networks. It is also an important part of cloud computing, as it enables organizations to access and share resources from different cloud providers.
