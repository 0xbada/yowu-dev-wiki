# Overview
Regression testing is a type of software testing that verifies that software which previously worked correctly still works correctly after a change. It is used to ensure that a change, such as a bug fix or new feature, does not introduce new problems.

# Description
Regression testing is a form of software testing that is used to verify that a change in the program, such as a bug fix or new feature, does not introduce new problems. It is a type of software testing that verifies that software that previously worked correctly still works correctly after a change. This type of testing is especially important when changes are made to existing software, since it is difficult to predict how the changes may affect the existing system.

Regression testing is typically done by executing a set of test cases that have been previously run on the software. This set of test cases is referred to as a "regression test suite". The goal of regression testing is to ensure that any changes made to the software do not cause any new problems, and that the existing functionality of the software is not affected.

Regression testing is typically done manually, but there are also automated tools available for regression testing. Automated regression testing tools can help to reduce the time and effort required for regression testing, as well as reduce the chance of errors in the testing process.

# Features
The main features of regression testing include:

- Verifying that software which previously worked correctly still works correctly after a change.
- Executing a set of test cases that have been previously run on the software.
- Reducing the time and effort required for regression testing.
- Reducing the chance of errors in the testing process.
- Ensuring that any changes made to the software do not cause any new problems.

# Example
For example, if a software developer fixes a bug in an existing program, they will likely want to run regression tests to ensure that the bug fix did not cause any new problems. The regression tests will be run on the existing test suite, and any new problems that are discovered will be reported.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantages of regression testing include:

- Ensuring that any changes made to the software do not cause any new problems.
- Reducing the time and effort required for regression testing.
- Reducing the chance of errors in the testing process.

The main disadvantages of regression testing include:

- It can be time consuming and costly to maintain a large regression test suite.
- It is difficult to predict how changes may affect the existing system.

# Related Technology
Regression testing is related to other types of software testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Unit testing is used to test individual components of a system, while integration testing is used to test the interactions between different components. System testing is used to test the entire system as a whole.

# Others
Regression testing is an important part of the software development process, as it helps to ensure that any changes made to the software do not cause any new problems. It is a type of software testing that is used to verify that software which previously worked correctly still works correctly after a change.
