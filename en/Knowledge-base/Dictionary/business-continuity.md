# Overview
Business continuity is a process that helps organizations prepare for and respond to disruptive events. It involves creating plans and procedures that ensure the organization can continue to operate in the face of a disaster or other unexpected event. Business continuity plans typically include strategies for dealing with disruptions to IT systems, communications, personnel, and other resources.

# History
The concept of business continuity has been around for centuries, but it has only become a formalized process in the last few decades. The first business continuity plans were developed in the 1970s in response to the growing threat of natural disasters, terrorism, and other threats. Since then, the process has evolved to include a wide range of strategies and procedures for dealing with any type of disruption.

# Description
Business continuity is a process that helps organizations prepare for and respond to disruptive events. It involves creating plans and procedures that ensure the organization can continue to operate in the face of a disaster or other unexpected event. Business continuity plans typically include strategies for dealing with disruptions to IT systems, communications, personnel, and other resources.

The primary goal of business continuity is to minimize the impact of a disruption on the organization. This is done by identifying potential risks and developing plans to mitigate them. The plans should include strategies for dealing with the disruption, such as restoring systems and services, relocating personnel, and communicating with customers and other stakeholders.

# Features
Business continuity plans typically include the following features:

- Risk assessment: Identifying potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate them.
- Business impact analysis: Identifying the potential impact of a disruption on the organization.
- Recovery strategies: Developing plans for restoring systems and services, relocating personnel, and communicating with customers and other stakeholders.
- Testing and training: Testing the plans and training personnel on how to respond to a disruption.

# Example
A good example of a business continuity plan is a disaster recovery plan. A disaster recovery plan is a set of procedures and strategies that an organization can use to restore its operations after a disaster. The plan should include strategies for restoring IT systems, communications, personnel, and other resources. It should also include procedures for communicating with customers and other stakeholders.

# Pros and Cons
The primary benefit of business continuity planning is that it helps organizations prepare for and respond to disruptive events. By identifying potential risks and developing plans to mitigate them, organizations can minimize the impact of a disruption on their operations.

The primary disadvantage of business continuity planning is that it can be costly and time-consuming. Developing plans and training personnel can take a significant amount of time and resources. Additionally, the plans may need to be updated regularly to account for changes in the organization or its environment.

# Related Technology
Business continuity is closely related to disaster recovery and business continuity management. Disaster recovery is the process of restoring IT systems and services after a disaster. Business continuity management is the process of managing the business continuity process, including developing plans, testing them, and training personnel.

# Digression
Business continuity is an important part of any organization's risk management strategy. It helps organizations prepare for and respond to disruptive events, minimizing the impact on their operations. While it can be costly and time-consuming, the benefits of business continuity planning far outweigh the costs.
