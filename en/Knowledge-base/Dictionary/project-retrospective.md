# Overview
A Project Retrospective is a meeting held at the end of a project to review the project’s successes and failures. During this meeting, a team reviews the project’s timeline, scope, and processes, and brainstorm ideas for improvement in the future. It is a way to capture the experience and lessons learned from the project and use them to make future projects more successful.

## History
The concept of a Project Retrospective was initially developed by the software development industry, but is now used in many different fields. The term was first coined by Norm Kerth in 2001 and has since become an essential tool for project teams to improve their performance and increase efficiency.

## Description
A Project Retrospective is usually held at the end of a project, but can also be held at any other point during the project's timeline. The goal of the meeting is to review the project's successes, failures, and processes, and to brainstorm ideas for improvement in the future. The meeting is typically facilitated by a project manager or other leader, and all team members are encouraged to contribute.

During a Project Retrospective, the team will typically review the project’s timeline, scope, and processes, and discuss any issues or challenges that arose. They may also brainstorm ideas for improvement, such as changes to processes, tools, or team structure. The team should also discuss any successes and ways to replicate them in the future. The goal is to identify areas where the project could have been improved and to create an action plan for future projects.

## Example
For example, a team may use a Project Retrospective to review the timeline and scope of a software development project. During the meeting, the team could discuss any challenges they faced during the project, such as technical issues, communication problems, or a lack of resources. They could then brainstorm ideas for improvement, such as using new tools or restructuring the team. The team could also discuss any successes and how to replicate them in the future.

## Pros and Cons
The main benefit of a Project Retrospective is that it provides an opportunity for the team to reflect on the project and identify areas for improvement. It is also a great way to capture the experience and lessons learned from the project and use them to make future projects more successful.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to a Project Retrospective. For example, the meeting can take a lot of time and energy, and team members may be hesitant to share their opinions or ideas. Additionally, it can be difficult to get everyone on the same page and identify actionable items.
