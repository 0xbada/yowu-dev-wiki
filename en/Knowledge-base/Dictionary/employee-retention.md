Employee retention is a critical metric for evaluating an organization's human resources policies. Retention measures the percentage of employees that remain with an organization for a specified period of time, usually a year or more. It is a measure of job satisfaction and loyalty, and is an important factor in determining an organization's success.

Employee retention can be measured in several ways, including employee turnover rate, employee satisfaction surveys, and employee engagement surveys. Employee turnover rate is the ratio of the number of employees who have left the organization to the total number of employees. Employee satisfaction surveys measure employee satisfaction with the organization's policies and procedures.

Organizations can use employee retention metrics to identify areas of improvement, such as providing better benefits or creating a better work-life balance. They can also use these metrics to assess the success of their human resources policies and strategies.
