# Overview
A document database is a type of non-relational database that is designed to store and query data as documents. Document databases are often used in applications that require a high degree of scalability and flexibility. They are also used in applications that require complex data structures and queries. Document databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases, as they do not use the traditional relational database model.

# Description
Document databases are designed to store and query data as documents. Documents are structured data that can contain any number of fields and values. Documents can also contain nested documents, which can contain any number of fields and values. This allows for complex data structures and queries.

Document databases are often used in applications that require a high degree of scalability and flexibility. This is because document databases can easily scale to accommodate large amounts of data and can be easily modified to accommodate changing data structures.

Document databases are also often used in applications that require complex data structures and queries. This is because document databases are designed to store and query data as documents, which can contain any number of fields and values. This allows for complex data structures and queries.

Document databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases, as they do not use the traditional relational database model. NoSQL databases are designed to store and query data as documents, rather than tables. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability.

# Features
Document databases have several features that make them well-suited for certain applications. These features include:

- Flexibility: Document databases are designed to store and query data as documents, which can contain any number of fields and values. This allows for greater flexibility in data structures and queries.

- Scalability: Document databases can easily scale to accommodate large amounts of data.

- Performance: Document databases are designed to be fast and efficient.

- Security: Document databases are designed to be secure and reliable.

# Example
A document database can be used to store and query data for a web application. For example, a web application may need to store user data, such as name, address, and phone number. A document database can be used to store this data as documents, which can contain any number of fields and values. This allows for greater flexibility in data structures and queries.

# Pros and Cons
Document databases have several advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages:

- Flexibility: Document databases are designed to store and query data as documents, which can contain any number of fields and values. This allows for greater flexibility in data structures and queries.

- Scalability: Document databases can easily scale to accommodate large amounts of data.

- Performance: Document databases are designed to be fast and efficient.

- Security: Document databases are designed to be secure and reliable.

Disadvantages:

- Complexity: Document databases can be complex to set up and maintain.

- Cost: Document databases can be expensive to set up and maintain.

# Controversy
Document databases have been controversial in the past due to their lack of standardization. Document databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases, as they do not use the traditional relational database model. This lack of standardization has led to some criticism of document databases.

# Related Technology
Document databases are often used in conjunction with other technologies. These technologies include:

- Object-relational mapping (ORM): ORM is a technique used to map objects to a relational database.

- Graph databases: Graph databases are designed to store and query data as graphs.

- Key-value stores: Key-value stores are designed to store and query data as key-value pairs.

# Digression
Document databases are often used in applications that require a high degree of scalability and flexibility. They are also used in applications that require complex data structures and queries. Document databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases, as they do not use the traditional relational database model.

# Others
Document databases are becoming increasingly popular in the software development world. They are often used in applications that require a high degree of scalability and flexibility. They are also used in applications that require complex data structures and queries. Document databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases, as they do not use the traditional relational database model.
