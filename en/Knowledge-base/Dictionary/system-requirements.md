# System Requirements

## Overview
System Requirements are the set of technical requirements that must be met for an application to be successfully installed and run on a computer. These requirements include hardware, software, and other system components.

## Description
System Requirements are typically stated by the application's developer or vendor. They are designed to ensure that the application will run properly on a given system. The requirements may include minimum and recommended hardware and software components, such as a specific processor type, operating system version, and memory size.

In addition to hardware and software components, system requirements may also include other system components, such as network connections, access to external services, or specific types of storage devices.

When installing an application, it is important to ensure that the system meets the requirements specified by the developer. If the system does not meet the requirements, the application may not run properly or may not run at all.

## Example
For example, an application may require a Windows operating system version 8.1 or higher, a 2GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, and 20GB of free disk space.

## Pros and Cons
The main benefit of system requirements is that they ensure that the application will run properly on the system. However, they can also limit the range of systems on which the application can be installed. For example, if the application requires a specific version of Windows, it may not be able to run on a Mac.

## Related Technology
System requirements are related to other topics such as system compatibility, hardware compatibility, software compatibility, and minimum system requirements.

## Digression
System requirements are sometimes confused with minimum system requirements, which are the minimum hardware and software components needed for an application to run properly. However, system requirements are typically more specific and may include additional components, such as network connections or access to external services.

## Others
System requirements are also sometimes referred to as "specifications" or "prerequisites".
