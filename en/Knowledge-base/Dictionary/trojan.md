# Overview
Trojan is a malicious form of computer program that appears to be a legitimate application. It is designed to provide an attacker with access to a target computer system, and it can be used to steal data, install malicious software, or gain unauthorized access to a system.

# History
The term “Trojan” was first used in the early 1990s to describe a form of malicious software. The term was inspired by the ancient Greek story of the “Trojan Horse”, in which the Greeks used a giant wooden horse to gain access to the city of Troy.

# Description
A Trojan is a type of malicious software that can be used to gain access to a computer system without the user’s knowledge or consent. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves, but they can be just as dangerous.

A Trojan can be used to steal information, install malicious software, or gain unauthorized access to a system. Typically, a Trojan is disguised as a legitimate application or used as part of a phishing attack to trick the user into downloading it. Once a Trojan is installed, it can be used to monitor the user’s activities, steal data, or even control the computer remotely.

# Digression
Trojans are often used in combination with other types of malware, such as viruses and worms. For example, a malicious program may be designed to spread itself by exploiting a security vulnerability in a computer system. Once the program has spread itself, it may then install a Trojan that can be used to monitor the user’s activities or steal data.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantage of a Trojan is that it can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system without the user’s knowledge or consent. This makes Trojans a powerful tool for attackers, as they can be used to gain access to sensitive data or install malicious software without the user’s knowledge. 

On the other hand, Trojans can also be used for legitimate purposes. For example, a system administrator may use a Trojan to remotely access a system for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes.
