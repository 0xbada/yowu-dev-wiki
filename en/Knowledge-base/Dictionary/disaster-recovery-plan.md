# Overview
A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a document that outlines the steps an organization should take to recover from a disruptive event such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or cyber attack. The plan outlines the resources needed, the order of activities to follow, and the timeline for each activity. It also includes procedures for testing and maintaining the plan.

# Description
A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is an organized approach to preparing for and responding to a disruptive event. It is an essential part of any organization's risk management strategy and should be tailored to the organization's particular needs and resources.

The DRP should include a detailed description of the organization’s critical systems and processes, as well as a list of key personnel and their roles in the recovery process. It should also include a timeline for each step in the recovery process and a list of resources that will be needed.

The plan should also include procedures for testing the plan and maintaining it over time. Testing should be done on a regular basis to ensure that the plan is up to date and that all personnel are familiar with the procedures. The plan should also be reviewed periodically to ensure that it is still relevant and that any changes in the organization’s operations or technology are taken into account.

# History
The concept of disaster recovery planning has been around since the early days of computing. In the 1950s, IBM developed the first comprehensive disaster recovery plan for its computers. Since then, disaster recovery planning has become an essential part of any organization's risk management strategy.

# Features
A DRP should include the following features:

- A detailed description of the organization’s critical systems and processes.
- A list of key personnel and their roles in the recovery process.
- A timeline for each step in the recovery process.
- A list of resources that will be needed.
- Procedures for testing the plan and maintaining it over time.

# Example
A disaster recovery plan for a small business might include the following steps:

1. Identify critical systems, processes, personnel, and resources.
2. Develop a timeline for each step in the recovery process.
3. Establish procedures for testing and maintaining the plan.
4. Create a backup system for critical data and documents.
5. Develop a communication plan for alerting personnel and customers.
6. Establish procedures for restoring systems and data.
7. Develop a plan for returning to normal operations.

# Pros and Cons
The primary benefit of a DRP is that it provides an organized and tested approach to responding to a disruptive event. It helps ensure that the organization is able to quickly and efficiently recover from the event.

The primary disadvantage of a DRP is that it can be time-consuming and expensive to develop and maintain. Additionally, if the plan is not tested regularly, it may not be effective in the event of a disaster.

# Related Technology
Disaster recovery plans are closely related to other risk management strategies such as business continuity plans and incident response plans. Business continuity plans focus on maintaining operations during a disruptive event, while incident response plans focus on responding to security incidents.

# Digression
Disaster recovery plans are often confused with backup plans. While both are important parts of an organization's risk management strategy, they serve different purposes. A backup plan is focused on creating and maintaining backups of critical data and systems, while a DRP is focused on responding to a disruptive event.

# Others
It is important to note that a DRP is not a substitute for other risk management strategies such as insurance or contingency planning. A DRP should be seen as an additional layer of protection that can help an organization respond more quickly and effectively to a disruptive event.
