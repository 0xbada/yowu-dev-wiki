# Overview
Code review is a process in which software developers review each other's code to ensure its quality and accuracy. It is an important part of the software development process and is often used to identify potential bugs and errors, improve code readability, and ensure that code follows coding standards. Code review is also used to share knowledge and best practices among developers.

# History
Code review has been around since the early days of software development. It was initially used to ensure that code was written in a consistent style and that it followed coding standards. Over time, code review has evolved to become an important part of the software development process.

# Description
Code review is a process in which software developers review each other's code to ensure its quality and accuracy. It is usually done by a team of developers, but it can also be done by a single developer. During a code review, developers look for potential bugs and errors, readability issues, and coding standards violations. They also use the code review process to share knowledge and best practices among developers.

# Features
Code review has several key features that make it an important part of the software development process. 

- **Quality Assurance:** Code review helps to ensure that code is of high quality and free of errors. It also helps to identify potential bugs and errors that may not be detected by automated testing.

- **Readability:** Code review helps to improve code readability by ensuring that code is written in a consistent style and follows coding standards.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Code review is a great way for developers to share knowledge and best practices among each other. It also helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to coding standards and conventions.

# Example
Let's look at an example of a code review. Suppose a team of developers is working on a web application. During the code review process, they will look at each other's code to ensure that it is of high quality and free of errors. They will also look for potential bugs and errors, readability issues, and coding standards violations. Finally, they will use the code review process to share knowledge and best practices among each other.

# Pros and Cons
Code review has several advantages and disadvantages. 

**Pros:**
- Ensures code quality and accuracy
- Improves code readability
- Shares knowledge and best practices

**Cons:**
- Can be time consuming
- Can be difficult to review complex code
- Can be difficult to review code written by someone else

# Controversy
Code review is not without its controversies. Some developers argue that code review can be time consuming and can slow down the development process. Others argue that code review is necessary to ensure code quality and accuracy.

# Related Technology
Code review is closely related to other software development processes, such as automated testing and continuous integration. Automated testing is used to identify potential bugs and errors, while continuous integration is used to ensure that code is always up to date and of high quality.

# Digression
Code review is an important part of the software development process and should not be overlooked. It helps to ensure code quality and accuracy, improve code readability, and share knowledge and best practices among developers. It is also important to remember that code review is not without its controversies and should be used with caution.
