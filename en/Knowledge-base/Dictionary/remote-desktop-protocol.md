# Overview 
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol developed by Microsoft that provides users with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. It allows users to access the resources and data on a remote computer as if they were sitting in front of it. RDP is commonly used for remote system administration and troubleshooting, as well as for accessing applications or files on a remote computer. 

# History 
RDP was first developed by Microsoft in 1995 and was initially included in the Windows NT 4.0 operating system. The protocol was later included in other versions of Windows, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. In 2014, Microsoft released an updated version of RDP, called Remote Desktop Protocol 8.1, which added support for new features such as RemoteFX and improved performance. 

# Description 
RDP is based on the client-server model, where a remote desktop client establishes a connection to a remote desktop server. The client sends commands to the server and the server executes them, sending the results back to the client. The client and server communicate using a proprietary protocol, which is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The client and server use a remote session protocol, such as Remote Framebuffer (RFB), to exchange graphical data and control information. The client can display the remote desktop on its own screen, allowing the user to interact with the remote computer as if it were local. The client and server can also exchange audio and printer data.

# Digression
RDP is designed to provide remote access to a computer's resources, including applications, files, and network resources. It is commonly used for system administration and troubleshooting, as well as for accessing applications or files on a remote computer. Additionally, RDP can be used for remote collaboration, allowing multiple users to access a single computer at the same time.
