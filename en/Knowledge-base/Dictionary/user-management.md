# Overview
User management is a type of software that helps organizations manage and control access to their systems and networks. It is used to create, delete, and modify user accounts, assign permissions to users, and set up authentication and authorization protocols.

# Description
User management is a type of software used by organizations to manage and control access to their systems and networks. It is used to create, delete, and modify user accounts, assign permissions to users, and set up authentication and authorization protocols.

User management systems are typically used to manage user accounts, passwords, and access rights. They are also used to set up authentication and authorization protocols, such as two-factor authentication or single sign-on.

User management systems can be used to set up different levels of access for different users. For example, an administrator may have full access to the system, while a regular user may only have access to certain areas.

The user management system can also be used to set up rules and policies that control how users interact with the system. For example, the system can be used to limit the number of failed login attempts a user can make before they are locked out of the system.

# Features
User management systems typically include the following features:

- User account creation and management
- Password management
- Access control
- Authentication and authorization protocols
- Rules and policies
- Security measures

# Example
An example of a user management system is Microsoft Active Directory. It is used to manage user accounts, passwords, access rights, and authentication protocols. It also allows administrators to set up rules and policies to control how users interact with the system.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantages of user management systems are that they make it easier to manage user accounts and access rights, and they provide a secure environment for users to access the system.

The main disadvantages of user management systems are that they can be complex to set up and maintain, and they can be costly to implement.

# Related Technology
User management systems are related to other types of software, such as identity management systems, access control systems, and authentication and authorization systems.
