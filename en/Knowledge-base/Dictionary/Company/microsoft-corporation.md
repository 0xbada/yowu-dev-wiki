# History

Microsoft Corporation was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. The company's first product was a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800, a personal computer kit. Microsoft's breakthrough came with the development of MS-DOS, which powered IBM's personal computers. The success of MS-DOS led to the development of Windows, which became the most widely used operating system in the world.

In the 1990s, Microsoft faced antitrust lawsuits in the United States and Europe. The lawsuits alleged that Microsoft had engaged in anti-competitive practices, such as bundling its Internet Explorer browser with Windows. Microsoft was eventually found guilty of antitrust violations and was forced to pay fines and make changes to its business practices.

In the early 2000s, Microsoft faced increased competition from companies such as Google and Apple. The company responded by diversifying its products and services, investing heavily in research and development, and forging partnerships with other companies.
