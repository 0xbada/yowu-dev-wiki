# Overview
Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that covers the cost of an individual's medical and surgical expenses. It is designed to protect individuals and families from financial hardship due to medical expenses. Health insurance plans can be purchased through employers, health insurance marketplaces, or directly from an insurance company. 

# Description
Health insurance plans are designed to help individuals and families pay for medical and surgical expenses. These expenses can include doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, prescription drugs, and other medical services. Health insurance plans typically have a variety of coverage options and deductibles, so individuals and families can choose the plan that best meets their needs. 

Health insurance plans are typically divided into two categories: managed care plans and fee-for-service plans. Managed care plans, such as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), require members to choose a primary care physician and obtain referrals for specialty care. Fee-for-service plans allow members to visit any provider, but may require members to pay a higher portion of their medical expenses. 

In addition to the cost of premiums, health insurance plans may also require members to pay a deductible before their insurance coverage kicks in. A deductible is a set amount of money that must be paid out-of-pocket before an insurance company will begin to pay for medical expenses. 

# History
The concept of health insurance has been around since the early 20th century. In 1929, the first employer-sponsored health insurance plan was created in Dallas, Texas. The plan was initially designed to provide employees with financial protection against the costs of medical care. 

In the 1950s, President Harry Truman proposed a national health insurance plan, but it was not passed. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which established Medicare and Medicaid. These programs provided health insurance coverage to the elderly and the poor, respectively. 

In the 1970s, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was passed, which allowed employers to offer health insurance plans to their employees. The 1980s saw an increase in the number of managed care plans, such as HMOs and PPOs. 

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law, which established health insurance marketplaces and provided subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance. 

# Features
Health insurance plans typically have a variety of features that can help individuals and families pay for medical expenses. These features can include: 

- Coverage for doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, and prescription drugs 
- Coverage for preventive care, such as vaccinations and annual physicals 
- Coverage for mental health services 
- Coverage for vision and dental care 
- Deductibles, which are the amount of money that must be paid out-of-pocket before an insurance company will begin to pay for medical expenses 
- Co-payments, which are the amount of money that must be paid out-of-pocket for each medical service 
- Coinsurance, which is a percentage of the cost of a medical service that must be paid out-of-pocket 
- Out-of-pocket maximums, which are the maximum amount of money that must be paid out-of-pocket in a year 

# Example
John is a self-employed entrepreneur who needs health insurance coverage. He purchases a health insurance plan through the health insurance marketplace. The plan has a $2,000 deductible and an out-of-pocket maximum of $5,000. If John visits his doctor for a checkup, he will have to pay the full cost of the visit, up to the deductible amount. After he has paid the deductible, the health insurance plan will cover 80% of the cost of the visit, and John will be responsible for the remaining 20%. If the cost of the visit is more than $5,000 in a year, John will not have to pay any additional money out-of-pocket.
