# Overview

Network management is the process of managing and maintaining a computer network, including its components, connections, and traffic. It involves monitoring, configuring, and troubleshooting the network to ensure optimal performance and security. Network management is an essential part of any successful IT infrastructure.

# Description

Network management is the process of monitoring, configuring, and troubleshooting a computer network. It includes activities such as monitoring the network for issues, configuring network settings, and troubleshooting problems. Network managers must also ensure that the network is secure and meets the organization's security and compliance requirements. 

Network management encompasses both hardware and software components. The hardware components include routers, switches, and other network devices. The software components include network management applications, such as those used for monitoring, configuration, and troubleshooting. 

Network management is an important part of any successful IT infrastructure. It helps ensure that the network is running optimally and securely, which can help improve user experience and reduce costs.

## Network Monitoring

Network monitoring is the process of monitoring the performance and availability of network components. Network monitoring tools allow network managers to detect and diagnose network issues quickly, which can help reduce downtime and improve user experience. 

Network monitoring tools can be used to monitor various metrics, such as latency, uptime, traffic, and bandwidth usage. They can also monitor the health of network devices, such as routers and switches.

## Network Configuration

Network configuration is the process of configuring network settings, such as IP addresses, DNS settings, and network security settings. Network configuration tools allow network managers to quickly and easily configure the network, which can reduce the time and cost associated with manual configuration. 

Network configuration tools can also be used to automate the process of configuring network settings and can help ensure that the settings are consistent across the network.

## Network Troubleshooting

Network troubleshooting is the process of identifying and resolving network issues. Network troubleshooting tools can help network managers quickly identify and diagnose network issues, which can help reduce downtime and improve user experience. 

Network troubleshooting tools can also be used to identify potential security issues, such as malware or unauthorized access, and can help ensure that the network is secure.
