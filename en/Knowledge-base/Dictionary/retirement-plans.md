# Overview
Retirement plans are financial arrangements that provide income to individuals after they retire from their jobs. These plans typically involve contributions from employers, employees, or both. Retirement plans come in many forms, including 401(k)s, IRAs, and pensions.

# Description
Retirement plans are an important part of planning for the future. They provide a way for individuals to save money for retirement and ensure they have a steady income when they stop working. Retirement plans can also provide tax benefits, as contributions are often tax-deductible.

There are many different types of retirement plans. The most common are 401(k)s, IRAs, and pensions.

A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Employees can contribute a portion of their salary to the plan, and employers may match a certain percentage of the employee’s contribution. The contributions are invested in stocks, bonds, and other investments. The money in the account grows tax-free until it is withdrawn.

An IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a personal retirement plan. Individuals can contribute up to a certain amount each year, and the contributions are tax deductible. The money in the account grows tax-free until it is withdrawn.

Pensions are employer-sponsored retirement plans. Employers make regular contributions to the plan, and employees may also contribute. When an employee retires, they receive a monthly payment from the plan.

# Features
Retirement plans provide a number of benefits to individuals. The most important is that they provide a steady source of income after retirement. Retirement plans also provide tax benefits, as contributions are often tax-deductible. In addition, retirement plans can provide peace of mind, as they help ensure that individuals will have enough money to live on after they retire.

# Example
John is a 45-year-old software engineer who has been working for the same company for the past 20 years. He has been contributing to a 401(k) since he started, and his employer has been matching his contributions. He has also been contributing to an IRA each year.

John has now decided to retire. He will be able to withdraw money from his 401(k) and IRA tax-free. He will also receive a monthly pension payment from his employer.
