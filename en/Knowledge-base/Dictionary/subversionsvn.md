# Overview
Subversion (SVN) is an open-source version control system used by developers to track changes in their source code. It allows users to store different versions of their code and manage changes made to it over time. The system also makes it easy to share code and collaborate on projects.

# History
Subversion was created in 2000 as an open-source alternative to the then-popular version control system CVS. It was developed by a group of developers who wanted to provide a better version control system that was easier to use and more robust than CVS. Since its initial release, Subversion has become one of the most popular version control systems in use today, with millions of users around the world.

# Description
Subversion is a centralized version control system, meaning that all code changes are stored in a central repository. This makes it easy for developers to collaborate on a project, as they can all access the same code base and see what changes each person has made. Subversion also allows for branching and merging, which allows developers to experiment with different versions of their code without affecting the main codebase.

Subversion also makes it easy to track changes over time. Each time a user checks in code to the repository, a new version is created. This makes it easy to roll back to an earlier version of the code if something goes wrong. Additionally, Subversion keeps a log of all changes made to the code, making it easy to see who made what changes and when.

# Digression
Subversion also has a number of features that make it easier for developers to collaborate on a project. It supports atomic commits, meaning that all changes made in a single commit will be applied at the same time. This prevents partially-completed code from being checked in and makes it easier for developers to work together without worrying about conflicting code changes.

Subversion also has access control, which allows administrators to set permissions for different users. This makes it easier to manage who can make changes to the code and who can only view the code.
