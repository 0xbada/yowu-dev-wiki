# Overview
Lean startup is an iterative approach to product development that emphasizes speed, testing, and learning. It has been popularized by Eric Ries, who wrote The Lean Startup, a book outlining the principles of the methodology. Lean startup is based on the idea that businesses should experiment quickly and frequently with their product offerings in order to learn what works and what doesn't.

# Description
The lean startup methodology is based on the idea that businesses should test and learn quickly, rather than relying on traditional business plans. It emphasizes the importance of failing quickly and learning from mistakes. The goal of the lean startup approach is to create a product that meets customers' needs without investing too much time and money.

The lean startup methodology is based on the "build-measure-learn" feedback loop. This loop involves building a product, measuring its performance, and learning from the results. This cycle is repeated until the product meets customer needs.

The lean startup approach also emphasizes the importance of customer feedback. Rather than relying on traditional market research, the lean startup methodology encourages businesses to get feedback directly from customers. This feedback can be used to inform product design and development decisions.

The lean startup methodology also emphasizes the importance of testing and experimentation. Businesses are encouraged to test their products and ideas quickly and frequently, in order to learn what works and what doesn't. This allows businesses to quickly pivot and adjust their product offerings to meet customer needs.

# History
The lean startup methodology was popularized by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup. The book was published in 2011 and quickly gained popularity among entrepreneurs and business leaders.

The lean startup methodology was based on the "build-measure-learn" feedback loop, which was developed by Steve Blank in the early 2000s. Blank's feedback loop was based on the "customer development" approach, which he developed in response to the failure of his own startup.

# Features
The lean startup methodology emphasizes the importance of speed and learning. Businesses are encouraged to test and learn quickly, rather than relying on traditional business plans.

The lean startup approach also emphasizes the importance of customer feedback. Rather than relying on traditional market research, the lean startup methodology encourages businesses to get feedback directly from customers. This feedback can be used to inform product design and development decisions.

The lean startup methodology also emphasizes the importance of testing and experimentation. Businesses are encouraged to test their products and ideas quickly and frequently, in order to learn what works and what doesn't. This allows businesses to quickly pivot and adjust their product offerings to meet customer needs.

# Example
One example of a business that has successfully implemented the lean startup methodology is Airbnb. Airbnb was founded in 2008 and has since become one of the most successful companies in the world.

The company has embraced the lean startup methodology, testing and learning quickly and frequently. For example, Airbnb tested different pricing strategies to find the one that worked best for their customers. They also used customer feedback to inform product design and development decisions.

# Pros and Cons
The lean startup methodology has many advantages. It emphasizes the importance of speed and learning, and encourages businesses to get feedback directly from customers. It also allows businesses to quickly pivot and adjust their product offerings to meet customer needs.

However, the lean startup methodology also has some drawbacks. It can be difficult to implement, and it can be challenging to measure the success of experiments. Additionally, the lean startup approach is not suited for all types of businesses.

# Controversy
The lean startup methodology has been controversial in some circles. Some critics argue that the approach is too focused on speed and experimentation, and that it can lead to businesses neglecting important aspects of product development. 

Other critics argue that the lean startup methodology is too focused on customer feedback, and that businesses should not rely too heavily on customer feedback when making product design and development decisions.

# Related Technology
The lean startup methodology is related to the Agile software development methodology. Both approaches emphasize the importance of speed and learning, and both encourage businesses to get feedback directly from customers.

The lean startup methodology is also related to the customer development approach developed by Steve Blank. Blank's approach was based on the "build-measure-learn" feedback loop, which is the foundation of the lean startup methodology.

# Digression
The lean startup methodology has been popularized by Eric Ries, who wrote The Lean Startup, a book outlining the principles of the methodology. The book was published in 2011 and quickly gained popularity among entrepreneurs and business leaders.

# Others
The lean startup methodology has been embraced by many successful companies, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Uber. These companies have successfully implemented the lean startup methodology, testing and learning quickly and frequently.

The lean startup methodology has also been used by governments and non-profit organizations. For example, the US government has used the lean startup approach to develop new policies and programs. Non-profit organizations have also used the lean startup methodology to develop new initiatives and projects.
