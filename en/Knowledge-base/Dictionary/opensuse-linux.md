# OpenSUSE Linux

## Overview

OpenSUSE is a Linux distribution that is widely used by developers and enthusiasts worldwide. It is a community-driven project that is based on the SUSE Linux Enterprise distribution. OpenSUSE is known for its stability, security, and user-friendly interface.

## Description

OpenSUSE is an open-source operating system that is designed for personal computers, servers, and workstations. It is based on the RPM package management system and the YaST configuration tool. OpenSUSE is available in two editions: Leap and Tumbleweed.

Leap is a regular release that is based on the SUSE Linux Enterprise source code. It is designed for stability and long-term support. Leap is ideal for users who want a reliable and predictable operating system.

Tumbleweed, on the other hand, is a rolling release that is updated continuously. It contains the latest packages and features, making it ideal for developers and enthusiasts who want to stay on the cutting edge of technology.

OpenSUSE comes with a wide range of software packages, including desktop environments, web browsers, office suites, multimedia tools, and development tools. It also supports a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and Ruby.

OpenSUSE is known for its user-friendly interface, which is based on the KDE Plasma desktop environment. It also supports other desktop environments, such as GNOME, Xfce, and LXQt.

## History

OpenSUSE was originally released in 1994 as S.u.S.E. Linux. It was created by Roland Dyroff and Hubert Mantel in Germany. The name S.u.S.E. stood for "Software und System Entwicklung" (Software and System Development).

In 2003, S.u.S.E. Linux was acquired by Novell, a software company based in the United States. Novell continued to develop and support the distribution until 2010, when it was sold to The Attachmate Group.

In 2011, The Attachmate Group merged with Micro Focus, a British software company. Micro Focus continued to support OpenSUSE until 2018, when it was acquired by SUSE, a German software company.

Since then, OpenSUSE has been a community-driven project that is supported by SUSE. It is developed by a global community of volunteers who work together to create a stable, secure, and user-friendly operating system.
