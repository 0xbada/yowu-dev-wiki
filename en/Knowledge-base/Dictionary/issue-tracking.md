# Overview
Issue tracking is a process used to manage and document the progress of resolving problems, known as “issues”, that arise during the development of software. It is an essential part of the software development process, as it allows teams to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues in a timely manner.

# Description
Issue tracking is a process used to track and manage issues (problems) that arise during the development of software. This process involves identifying the issue, assigning it to the appropriate team member, and documenting the progress of the issue’s resolution. 

Issue tracking can be used to manage any type of issue, from technical bugs to customer complaints. It is an important part of the software development process, as it allows teams to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues in a timely manner.

Issue tracking systems are typically web-based applications that allow teams to track and manage issues. These systems often include features such as issue tracking, bug tracking, and project management. They also provide tools for communication, collaboration, and reporting.

# History
The concept of issue tracking has been around since the 1970s. Early issue tracking systems were typically manual, paper-based processes. In the 1980s, the first electronic issue tracking systems were developed, and these systems continued to evolve throughout the 1990s.

In the 2000s, web-based issue tracking systems began to emerge. These systems allowed teams to track and manage issues in a centralized, web-based environment. Today, issue tracking systems are used by teams of all sizes to manage and document the progress of resolving issues.

# Features
Issue tracking systems typically include features such as:

- Issue tracking: Allows teams to track and manage issues.
- Bug tracking: Allows teams to track and manage bugs.
- Project management: Allows teams to manage projects.
- Communication tools: Allows teams to communicate and collaborate.
- Reporting: Allows teams to generate reports on issues.

# Example
An example of an issue tracking system is JIRA. JIRA is a web-based issue tracking system that allows teams to track and manage issues. It includes features such as issue tracking, bug tracking, project management, communication tools, and reporting.

# Pros and Cons
The main advantage of issue tracking systems is that they allow teams to track and manage issues in a centralized, web-based environment. This makes it easier for teams to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues in a timely manner.

The main disadvantage of issue tracking systems is that they can be complex and time-consuming to set up and use. They also require teams to have a certain level of technical knowledge to use them effectively.

# Related Technology
Issue tracking systems are related to bug tracking systems and project management systems. Bug tracking systems are used to track and manage software bugs, while project management systems are used to manage projects.

# Digression
Issue tracking is an important part of the software development process. It allows teams to identify, prioritize, and resolve issues in a timely manner, which can help ensure the success of a project. 

# Others
Issue tracking systems are essential tools for software development teams. They allow teams to track and manage issues in a centralized, web-based environment, which can help ensure the success of a project.
