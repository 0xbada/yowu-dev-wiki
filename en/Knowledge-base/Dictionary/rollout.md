# Description
Rollout is a feature flagging and release management platform that helps software teams launch features faster and more securely. It enables teams to quickly and safely deploy new features, test them in production, and roll them out to specific users or groups.

With Rollout, teams can control which users have access to new features, and can easily enable or disable features at any time. This helps teams test new features in a safe and secure environment, as well as quickly roll back any changes if necessary.

Rollout also provides analytics and insights to help teams measure the impact of their features. This includes real-time analytics, such as usage and performance metrics, as well as A/B testing to compare different versions of a feature.
