# Overview
Enterprise architecture is a practice of analyzing, designing, and implementing the structure of a business's IT systems, processes, and infrastructure. It is used to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and security of the enterprise’s IT environment.

# Description
Enterprise architecture (EA) is a holistic approach to managing an organization’s IT systems and processes. It is used to ensure that the IT infrastructure is aligned with the organization’s business objectives and strategic goals. EA helps organizations identify the most efficient and effective ways to use IT resources to achieve their goals.

EA is typically divided into three main categories: business architecture, application architecture, and technology architecture. Business architecture focuses on the organization’s business processes and how they interact with each other. Application architecture focuses on the applications and services used to support the business processes. Technology architecture focuses on the hardware, software, and networks that enable the applications and services to function.

EA is a complex and ongoing process. It requires a deep understanding of the organization’s business processes, applications, and technology. It also requires continuous monitoring and updating to ensure that the IT environment is aligned with the organization’s strategic goals.

# History
The concept of enterprise architecture has been around since the 1960s. In the 1970s, the United States Department of Defense began using the term “enterprise architecture” to refer to the process of designing and implementing IT systems to support its operations. In the 1980s, the term was adopted by the private sector and began to be used to refer to the process of designing and implementing IT systems to support the operations of businesses.

# Features
The main features of enterprise architecture include:

- Analyzing the organization’s current IT systems and processes.
- Designing a new IT infrastructure that is aligned with the organization’s business objectives and strategic goals.
- Implementing the new IT infrastructure.
- Monitoring and updating the IT infrastructure to ensure that it remains aligned with the organization’s strategic goals.

# Example
A company wants to improve the efficiency of its customer service operations. The company’s enterprise architecture team would analyze the current customer service IT systems and processes, design a new customer service IT infrastructure that is aligned with the company’s business objectives and strategic goals, implement the new customer service IT infrastructure, and monitor and update the IT infrastructure to ensure that it remains aligned with the company’s strategic goals.

# Pros and Cons
The main pros of enterprise architecture are:

- Increased efficiency of IT systems and processes.
- Improved security of IT systems and processes.
- Alignment of IT systems and processes with the organization’s business objectives and strategic goals.

The main cons of enterprise architecture are:

- High cost of implementation.
- Time-consuming process.
- Difficulty in monitoring and updating the IT infrastructure.

# Related Technology
Enterprise architecture is closely related to other IT disciplines such as systems engineering, software engineering, and network engineering. It is also closely related to project management and business process management.
