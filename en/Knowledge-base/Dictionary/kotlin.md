# Overview
Kotlin is a statically-typed, cross-platform programming language developed by JetBrains. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and it is fully interoperable with Java.

# Description
Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language that is designed to be concise, safe, and expressive. It is a general-purpose language that is suitable for developing a wide range of applications, from server-side applications to mobile applications. Kotlin is a statically-typed language, meaning that the type of a variable must be specified before it can be used. This helps to prevent errors, improve code readability, and provide better performance.

Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning that it can be used to develop applications in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It also supports compilation to JavaScript source code, allowing Kotlin applications to be deployed to web browsers. Kotlin is also designed to be used with the LLVM compiler infrastructure, allowing it to be used for a variety of platforms.

Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and it supports features such as classes, objects, inheritance, generics, lambdas, and more. It also has built-in support for functional programming, allowing developers to write code in a more concise and expressive way.

Kotlin is designed to be a safe language, with features such as null safety, type inference, and more. This helps to prevent errors and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. It also has built-in support for concurrency, allowing developers to write code that can run in parallel.

# History
Kotlin was created by JetBrains, a software development company based in Prague, Czech Republic. It was announced in July 2011 and the first version was released in February 2016. Since then, it has become one of the most popular programming languages, and it is used by companies such as Google, Pinterest, and Square.

# Features
Kotlin is a statically-typed, cross-platform programming language. It is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and it is fully interoperable with Java. It supports features such as classes, objects, inheritance, generics, lambdas, and more. It also has built-in support for functional programming, null safety, type inference, concurrency, and more.

# Example
The following is an example of a simple "Hello World" program written in Kotlin:

```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello World!")
}
```

# Pros and Cons
Kotlin has many advantages, such as being concise, safe, and expressive. It is also fully interoperable with Java, allowing developers to use existing Java libraries and frameworks. Additionally, it has built-in support for functional programming and concurrency, allowing developers to write code that can run in parallel.

However, Kotlin does have some disadvantages. It is a relatively new language, meaning that there is not as much documentation or support available. Additionally, it is not as widely used as other languages, such as Java or Python, meaning that it may be more difficult to find developers who are familiar with it.

# Controversy
Kotlin has been controversial in some circles, with some people arguing that it is not a true object-oriented language. Additionally, some have argued that it is too similar to Java, and that it does not offer enough unique features to justify its existence.

# Related Technology
Kotlin is related to other programming languages, such as Java, Scala, and Groovy. It is also related to other technologies, such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

# Digression
Kotlin has been gaining popularity in recent years, and it is now used by many companies, such as Google, Pinterest, and Square. It is also used in many open source projects, such as the Spring Framework and the Android operating system.

# Others
Kotlin is an open source language, and its source code is available on GitHub. Additionally, JetBrains provides a variety of tools and resources for developers, such as an online compiler and a plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
