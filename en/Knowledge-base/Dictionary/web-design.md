## Description
Web design involves creating a website's visual design, content, and coding. It encompasses a range of disciplines, including user experience, interface design, and coding. A web designer will take into account the user's needs and preferences, as well as the organization's goals, when creating the design. This includes considering the layout, colors, fonts, images, and other elements of the website.

The web designer will also be responsible for coding the website, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This involves writing the code that will control the behavior of the website, such as the navigation, forms, and other features.

Web design is an important part of any organization's digital presence, as it helps create a positive user experience and influences how users interact with the website.
