# Overview

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of a procedure or a routine. It is a top-down approach to programming where the program is divided into smaller subroutines or procedures to perform a task. Procedural programming languages are designed to execute a sequence of statements that lead to a specific result.

# Description

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of a procedure or a routine. It is a structured programming approach where the program is divided into smaller subroutines or procedures to perform a task. These procedures are designed to execute a sequence of statements that lead to a specific result.

Procedural programming languages are designed to be efficient and easy to understand. They are used in a variety of applications, including scientific and engineering applications, business applications, and even video games.

The main focus of procedural programming is on the procedures or functions that are used in the program. These procedures are designed to perform a specific task and can be reused throughout the program. This makes the program more modular and easier to maintain.

Procedural programming languages are designed to be easy to learn and use. They are typically used in introductory programming courses because they are easy to understand and provide a solid foundation for more advanced programming concepts.

# History

Procedural programming has been around since the early days of computer programming. It was first introduced in the late 1950s with the development of the Fortran programming language. Fortran was designed for scientific and engineering applications and was one of the first programming languages to use a procedural programming approach.

In the 1960s, the COBOL programming language was developed for business applications. COBOL also used a procedural programming approach and became one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

In the 1970s, the C programming language was developed. C was designed to be a low-level programming language that could be used to develop operating systems and other system software. C also used a procedural programming approach and became one of the most popular programming languages of all time.

# Features

Procedural programming languages have several key features that make them popular among programmers. These features include:

- Modularity: Procedural programming languages are designed to be modular. This means that the program is divided into smaller subroutines or procedures that can be reused throughout the program.

- Top-down approach: Procedural programming is a top-down approach to programming. The program is designed by breaking it down into smaller and smaller subroutines until each subroutine performs a specific task.

- Easy to learn: Procedural programming languages are easy to learn and understand. They are typically used in introductory programming courses because they provide a solid foundation for more advanced programming concepts.

- Efficient: Procedural programming languages are designed to be efficient. They use a minimal amount of memory and processing power to execute the program.

# Example

Here is an example of a simple program written in a procedural programming language:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int num1, num2, sum;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

    sum = num1 + num2;

    printf("Sum = %d", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

This program prompts the user to enter two numbers, adds them together, and then displays the sum.

# Pros and Cons

Procedural programming has several advantages and disadvantages.

## Pros

- Modularity: Procedural programming is designed to be modular, which makes the program easier to maintain and modify.

- Easy to learn: Procedural programming languages are easy to learn and understand, which makes them a good choice for beginning programmers.

- Efficient: Procedural programming languages are designed to be efficient, which means that they use a minimal amount of memory and processing power.

## Cons

- Limited scalability: Procedural programming can become difficult to manage as the program grows larger.

- Limited reusability: Procedural programming can become difficult to reuse code as the program grows larger.

- Limited flexibility: Procedural programming can become difficult to modify as the program grows larger.

# Controversy

Procedural programming is not without controversy. Some programmers believe that procedural programming is outdated and that object-oriented programming is a better approach to programming.

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are templates for creating objects. Object-oriented programming is designed to be more flexible and scalable than procedural programming.

However, procedural programming is still widely used and is a solid foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts.

# Related Technology

Procedural programming is related to several other programming concepts, including:

- Structured programming: Structured programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of structured control flow. It is a top-down approach to programming that is similar to procedural programming.

- Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. It is a more flexible and scalable approach to programming than procedural programming.

- Functional programming: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of functions. It is a more declarative approach to programming than procedural programming.

# Digression

Procedural programming is a solid foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts. It is easy to learn and understand, and it provides a good introduction to programming.

However, as programs become more complex, procedural programming can become difficult to manage. Object-oriented programming is a more flexible and scalable approach to programming that is better suited for complex programs.

Regardless of the programming paradigm used, it is important to choose the right tool for the job. Procedural programming is a good choice for small to medium-sized programs, while object-oriented programming is a better choice for larger and more complex programs.

# Others

In conclusion, procedural programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of a procedure or a routine. It is a structured programming approach where the program is divided into smaller subroutines or procedures to perform a task. Procedural programming languages are designed to be efficient and easy to understand, and they are used in a variety of applications. While procedural programming is not without controversy, it is still a solid foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts.
