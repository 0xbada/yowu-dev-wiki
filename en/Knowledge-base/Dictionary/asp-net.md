# Overview

ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to create dynamic web applications, services, and websites. It is based on the .NET Framework and is a part of the Microsoft .NET platform.

# Description

ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that enables developers to create dynamic web applications, services, and websites. It is based on the .NET Framework, a software framework that provides a comprehensive library of pre-coded solutions for common programming tasks. ASP.NET is a part of the Microsoft .NET platform, which also includes the .NET Framework, Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, and Windows Presentation Foundation.

ASP.NET applications are written using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side programming languages such as C# and VB.NET. ASP.NET provides a number of features that make it easier for developers to create web applications, including a built-in development server, a powerful object-oriented programming model, and a rich set of controls and components.

ASP.NET is a popular choice for web development, as it is easy to learn and use and provides a number of powerful features. It is also widely used in enterprise applications, as it is highly scalable and secure.

# Features

ASP.NET provides a number of features that make it easier for developers to create web applications. These include:

- A built-in development server, which allows developers to test their applications without having to deploy them to a web server.

- A powerful object-oriented programming model, which makes it easy to create complex applications.

- A rich set of controls and components, which can be used to quickly create user interfaces.

- Support for a wide range of server-side programming languages, including C# and VB.NET.

- Support for a wide range of databases, including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL.

- Support for AJAX, which allows developers to create interactive web applications.

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
