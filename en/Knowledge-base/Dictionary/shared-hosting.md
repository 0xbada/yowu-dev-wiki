# Overview
Shared hosting is a type of web hosting service that allows multiple websites to be hosted on a single web server. It is a cost-effective solution for small businesses and individuals who need to host their websites without the expense of a dedicated server. Shared hosting is often used by web hosting companies to provide hosting services to their customers.

# Description
Shared hosting is a type of web hosting service that allows multiple websites to be hosted on a single web server. The web server is typically owned and managed by a web hosting company, who provides hosting services to their customers. In shared hosting, the web server is shared among multiple customers, each with their own domain name and website. 

The advantages of shared hosting are that it is cost-effective and easy to use. Since the web server is shared among multiple customers, the hosting company can offer lower prices than if each customer had their own server. Additionally, since the hosting company is responsible for managing the server, customers do not need to worry about the technical aspects of running a web server.

The main disadvantage of shared hosting is that it can be slow and unreliable. Since the web server is shared among multiple customers, the performance of each website can be affected by the other websites on the server. Additionally, since the hosting company is responsible for managing the server, customers may not have full control over the server and may not be able to customize it to their needs.

# Features
Shared hosting typically includes the following features:

* Web server: The web server is the main component of shared hosting. It is responsible for serving web pages to visitors.

* Storage: Shared hosting typically includes a certain amount of storage space for customers to store their website files.

* Bandwidth: Shared hosting typically includes a certain amount of bandwidth, which is the amount of data that can be transferred from the server to visitors.

* Email accounts: Shared hosting typically includes a certain number of email accounts, which can be used to send and receive emails.

* Control panel: Shared hosting typically includes a control panel, which is a web-based interface that allows customers to manage their websites.

# Example
For example, a web hosting company may offer shared hosting plans that include the following features:

* Web server: Apache
* Storage: 10GB
* Bandwidth: 100GB/month
* Email accounts: 10
* Control panel: cPanel

# Pros and Cons
Shared hosting has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantages are that it is cost-effective and easy to use. The main disadvantages are that it can be slow and unreliable.

# Pros

# Related Technology
Shared hosting is often used in conjunction with other web hosting services, such as virtual private servers (VPS) and dedicated servers. VPS hosting is similar to shared hosting, but it provides more control and flexibility to customers. Dedicated servers are more expensive than shared hosting, but they provide the highest level of performance and control.
