# Overview
MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database system. It is a NoSQL database, meaning it stores data in a flexible and non-relational way. MongoDB is used by many companies, both large and small, to store data in a secure and efficient manner.

# History
MongoDB was created in 2007 by a company called 10gen. The company was founded by three software engineers â€“ Eliot Horowitz, Dwight Merriman, and Kevin Ryan. The first version of MongoDB was released in 2009. Since then, MongoDB has been continuously improved and is now used by many companies around the world.

# Description
MongoDB is a document-oriented database system. This means that it stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. Documents are stored in collections, which are similar to tables in relational databases. MongoDB stores data in a flexible way, which allows it to handle different types of data without requiring a predefined schema.

MongoDB is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data. It is also designed to be highly available, meaning that it can continue to operate even in the event of hardware or network failures.

# Digression
MongoDB is a popular choice for many companies, due to its scalability, flexibility, and availability. It is used in a variety of applications, from web applications to mobile apps. MongoDB can also be used to store data in the cloud, making it an attractive choice for companies that need to store large amounts of data.
