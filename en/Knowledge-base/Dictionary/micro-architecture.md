# Overview

Micro architecture is a type of computer architecture that focuses on the design of individual components within a computer system. It is concerned with the relationship between the components, their functionality, and the way they interact with each other. It is a subset of computer architecture, which is concerned with the overall design of the system.

# Description

Micro architecture is a type of computer architecture that focuses on the design of individual components within a computer system. It is concerned with the relationship between the components, their functionality, and the way they interact with each other. It is a subset of computer architecture, which is concerned with the overall design of the system.

The micro architecture of a computer system is determined by the components it contains and their interactions. These components include the processor, memory, input/output devices, and other components such as graphics cards and sound cards. The micro architecture determines how these components work together and how they interact with each other.

The micro architecture of a computer system is also determined by the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the processor. The ISA defines the set of instructions that the processor can execute, as well as the data formats and addressing modes it can use. The ISA is often the same across different processors, so a computer system with the same ISA can run the same programs.

The micro architecture of a computer system is also determined by the design of the processor. The processor design includes the number of cores, the size of the caches, the speed of the processor, and other details. The processor design determines how quickly the processor can execute instructions and how much data it can process at once.

The micro architecture of a computer system is also determined by the design of the memory system. The memory system includes the type of memory (such as DRAM or SRAM), the size of the memory, the speed of the memory, and other details. The memory system determines how quickly the processor can access data from memory and how much data it can store.

The micro architecture of a computer system is also determined by the design of the input/output devices. The input/output devices include the keyboard, mouse, and other input/output devices such as a printer or a scanner. The input/output devices determine how quickly the processor can receive input from the user and how quickly it can send output to the user.

# History

Micro architecture has been around since the early days of computing. The first computers were built using micro architecture, as they were designed to be small and efficient. As computers became more powerful, micro architecture was used to design powerful components such as processors and memory systems.

In the 1970s, micro architecture began to be used to design the components of personal computers. This allowed for more powerful computers that could be used by individuals for personal computing.

In the 1980s, micro architecture was used to design the components of workstations and servers. This allowed for more powerful computers that could be used for business and scientific applications.

In the 1990s, micro architecture was used to design the components of embedded systems. This allowed for small, low-power computers that could be used in a wide variety of applications.

# Features

The main feature of micro architecture is its focus on the design of individual components within a computer system. This allows for more efficient and powerful computer systems, as the components are designed to work together.

Another feature of micro architecture is its use of instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA defines the set of instructions that the processor can execute, as well as the data formats and addressing modes it can use. This allows for programs written for one processor to be run on another processor with the same ISA.

A third feature of micro architecture is its use of processor design. The processor design includes the number of cores, the size of the caches, the speed of the processor, and other details. This allows for more powerful processors that can execute instructions more quickly and process more data at once.

A fourth feature of micro architecture is its use of memory system design. The memory system includes the type of memory (such as DRAM or SRAM), the size of the memory, the speed of the memory, and other details. This allows for faster access to data stored in memory.

A fifth feature of micro architecture is its use of input/output device design. The input/output devices include the keyboard, mouse, and other input/output devices such as a printer or a scanner. This allows for faster input from the user and faster output to the user.

# Example

An example of micro architecture is the design of the Intel Core i7 processor. The processor has four cores, 8MB of cache, and a clock speed of 3.4GHz. It also has a 64-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) and supports DDR4 memory. The processor design, instruction set architecture, and memory system design all work together to provide a powerful and efficient processor.

# Pros and Cons

The main advantage of micro architecture is its focus on the design of individual components within a computer system. This allows for more efficient and powerful computer systems, as the components are designed to work together.

The main disadvantage of micro architecture is that it can be difficult to design and implement. It requires a lot of knowledge and expertise to design a computer system with the right components and the right interactions between them.

# Related Technology

Computer architecture is a related field to micro architecture. Computer architecture is concerned with the overall design of the computer system, while micro architecture is concerned with the design of individual components within the system.

Another related field is system-on-chip (SoC) design. SoC design is concerned with the design of integrated circuits that contain multiple components, such as processors, memory, and input/output devices, on a single chip.

# Others

Micro architecture is an important field of computer engineering. It is used to design powerful and efficient computer systems, and is used in a wide variety of applications. It requires a lot of knowledge and expertise to design a computer system with the right components and the right interactions between them.
