# Overview
Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks, and data from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution. Physical security typically involves the use of physical barriers, such as locks, access control systems, alarms, and surveillance systems, to prevent unauthorized access to facilities, equipment, and resources.

# Description
Physical security is a crucial element of any security plan and is used to protect personnel, hardware, software, networks, and data from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution. Physical security typically involves the use of physical barriers, such as locks, access control systems, alarms, and surveillance systems, to prevent unauthorized access to facilities, equipment, and resources.

Physical security measures can be divided into two main categories: active and passive. Active measures are those that actively seek to prevent unauthorized access, such as locks, access control systems, and alarm systems. Passive measures are those that passively protect against unauthorized access, such as fencing, surveillance systems, and security guards.

Physical security can also be divided into two types: deterring and delaying. Deterring physical security measures are designed to make it difficult or impossible for intruders to gain access to a facility or resource. Delaying physical security measures are designed to slow down an intruder, giving security personnel more time to respond to an intrusion.

Physical security measures should be tailored to the specific needs of the organization and its environment. For example, an organization operating in a high-risk environment may need more robust physical security measures than an organization operating in a low-risk environment.

# Features
Physical security features include:

- Locks: Locks are one of the most basic physical security measures and are used to prevent unauthorized access to a facility or resource.

- Access Control Systems: Access control systems are used to monitor and control access to a facility or resource. These systems typically use keycards, biometric readers, or other authentication methods to verify the identity of individuals seeking access.

- Alarms: Alarms are used to alert security personnel to potential intrusions. Alarms can be triggered by motion, pressure, vibration, or other sensors.

- Surveillance Systems: Surveillance systems, such as CCTV cameras, are used to monitor and record activity in and around a facility or resource.

- Fencing: Fencing is used to physically separate a facility or resource from the outside world.

- Security Guards: Security guards are used to provide additional protection to a facility or resource.

# Example
For example, a bank may implement the following physical security measures:

- Locks on all doors and windows.
- Access control system with keycards or biometric readers.
- Alarms triggered by motion, pressure, vibration, or other sensors.
- CCTV cameras to monitor activity in and around the building.
- Fencing to physically separate the building from the outside world.
- Security guards to provide additional protection.

# Pros and Cons
The primary benefit of physical security measures is the prevention of unauthorized access to a facility or resource. Physical security measures can also be used to deter potential intruders, as well as to slow down intruders, giving security personnel more time to respond to an intrusion.

The primary disadvantage of physical security measures is their cost. Physical security measures can be expensive to install and maintain, and they may not be feasible in some environments. Additionally, physical security measures can be circumvented by determined intruders.

# Related Technology
Physical security measures are often used in conjunction with other security measures, such as logical access control systems, network security measures, and encryption. Additionally, physical security measures are often used in conjunction with other security measures, such as logical access control systems, network security measures, and encryption.

# Digression
Physical security measures should be tailored to the specific needs of the organization and its environment. For example, an organization operating in a high-risk environment may need more robust physical security measures than an organization operating in a low-risk environment. Additionally, physical security measures should be regularly tested and updated to ensure that they remain effective.
