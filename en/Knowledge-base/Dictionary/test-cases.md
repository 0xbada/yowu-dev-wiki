# Test Cases

## Overview
Test cases are a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly. Test cases are often referred to as test scripts, particularly when written.

## Description
A test case is a set of steps and preconditions which a tester uses to execute a software feature or part of a feature. Test cases are typically used to validate that the feature meets the requirements and works correctly.

Test cases are often written before the feature is developed, and are used to guide the development process. This is known as test-driven development.

Test cases can also be used to validate that the feature works correctly after development is complete. This is known as regression testing.

Test cases are generally written in a structured format, such as a table or text document. The most common elements of a test case are a unique identifier, a description of the feature, the expected result, and the actual result.

Test cases are often organized into suites, which are collections of related test cases. A suite may include test cases for a particular feature, or for a particular type of feature, such as UI or performance testing.

## Features
Test cases are designed to validate that a feature works correctly and meets the requirements. They are written in a structured format, and are organized into suites for easy management.

## Example
A test case for a login feature might look like this:

* **Test Case ID:** TC001
* **Description:** User is able to login with valid credentials
* **Expected Result:** User is able to login successfully
* **Actual Result:** User is able to login successfully

## Pros and Cons
The main benefit of test cases is that they provide a structured way to validate that a feature works correctly. This helps to ensure that the feature meets the requirements, and that it works as expected.

The main disadvantage of test cases is that they can be time consuming to write and maintain. This can be especially true if the feature is complex, or if there are many different scenarios to test.

## Related Technology
Test cases are often used in combination with other testing techniques, such as automated testing, manual testing, and exploratory testing.

## Digression
Test cases are a useful tool for software development teams, but they are not the only way to validate that a feature works correctly. Other techniques, such as manual testing and exploratory testing, can be used to supplement test cases and provide additional validation.

## Others
Test cases are an important part of the software development process, and should be used to ensure that features meet the requirements and work correctly. They are not the only way to validate a feature, but they can be a useful tool when used in combination with other testing techniques.
