# Career

Dave Cutler began his career in the field of computer science in the 1960s, when he joined the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). At DEC, Cutler was involved in the development of several important operating systems, including the VAX/VMS system, which was widely regarded as one of the most advanced operating systems of its time.

In 1988, Cutler left DEC to join Microsoft, where he was tasked with leading the development of a new operating system that would eventually become Windows NT. Cutler's work on Windows NT was groundbreaking, as it represented a departure from Microsoft's previous operating systems, which were based on the MS-DOS platform.

Under Cutler's leadership, Windows NT was designed to be a more robust and reliable operating system than its predecessors. It was also designed to be more scalable, allowing it to be used on a wide range of hardware platforms, from small desktop computers to large servers.

Windows NT was released in 1993 and was an immediate success. It quickly became the operating system of choice for businesses and organizations around the world, and it paved the way for the development of other important Microsoft technologies, such as the .NET Framework and the Azure cloud platform.

Cutler continued to work at Microsoft for many years, and he was involved in the development of several other important technologies, including the Xbox gaming console and the Hyper-V virtualization platform. He retired from Microsoft in 2014, after more than 25 years with the company.
