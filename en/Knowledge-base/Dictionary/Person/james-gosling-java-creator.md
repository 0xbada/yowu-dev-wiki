## Description
James Arthur Gosling, OC is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language. Gosling is widely known as the father of Java and is also the author of the book The Joy of Java. He was the chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems, and is a vice president and fellow at Oracle Corporation.

Gosling was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Calgary and a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University. He is a distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services.

Gosling is credited with inventing the Java programming language in 1994. He designed the language with the goal of allowing developers to write code that could run on any platform, without having to rewrite the code for each platform. Java has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is used for a wide variety of applications, from web development to mobile applications.

Gosling has also been involved in the development of other programming languages, including Oak, an early version of Java, and the Modula-3 programming language. He has also been involved in the development of the Apache Harmony project, an open source implementation of the Java platform.

## Life
James Gosling was born on May 19, 1955 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He attended the University of Calgary, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science in 1977. He then went on to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, which he completed in 1983.

Gosling began his career at Sun Microsystems in 1984, where he worked on a number of projects, including the NeWS window system and the SunOS operating system. In 1991, he began work on the Java programming language, which he completed in 1994.

## Career
Gosling is best known for his work on the Java programming language, which he developed while working at Sun Microsystems. He was the chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems from 2001 to 2006, and is currently a vice president and fellow at Oracle Corporation.

Gosling has also been involved in the development of other programming languages, including Oak, an early version of Java, and the Modula-3 programming language. He has also been involved in the development of the Apache Harmony project, an open source implementation of the Java platform.

Gosling has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, the IEEE John von Neumann Medal, and the Japan Prize. He was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2004, and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2007.
