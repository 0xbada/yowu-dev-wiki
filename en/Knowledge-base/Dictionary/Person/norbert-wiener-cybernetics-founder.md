## Description

Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) was an American mathematician, philosopher, and founder of cybernetics. He is best known for his work on the mathematical theory of communication, which he developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Wiener's work laid the foundation for the development of modern computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

Wiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, and grew up in Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University, where he earned his PhD in mathematics in 1917. After graduating, he taught at Harvard and later at Tufts University. In the 1930s, Wiener began to develop his mathematical theory of communication, which he called "cybernetics". He published his first book on the subject in 1948, and it became an instant classic.

Wiener's work had a profound influence on the development of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He was also a pioneer in the field of robotics, and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern robots. Wiener was a prolific writer, and his books and articles on cybernetics, mathematics, and philosophy are still widely read today.

## Life

Norbert Wiener was born on November 26, 1894 in Columbia, Missouri. He was the son of Leo Wiener, a professor of Slavic languages at Harvard University, and Bertha Kahn Wiener, a pianist. Wiener was a precocious child, and he was able to read by the age of three. He attended Harvard University, where he earned his PhD in mathematics in 1917.

Wiener married Margaret Engemann in 1921, and they had two children, Joseph and Margaret. Wiener and his family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1923, where he taught at Harvard and later at Tufts University.

## Career

Wiener's career as a mathematician began in the 1920s, when he began to develop his mathematical theory of communication. He published his first book on the subject in 1948, and it became an instant classic.

Wiener's work had a profound influence on the development of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He was also a pioneer in the field of robotics, and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern robots. Wiener was a prolific writer, and his books and articles on cybernetics, mathematics, and philosophy are still widely read today.

Wiener was also a noted philosopher, and he wrote extensively on the ethical implications of technology. He was a vocal critic of the military-industrial complex, and he argued that technology should be used for the benefit of humanity, not for its destruction.

## Relationships with Celebrities

Wiener was a close friend of the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell, and the two men often exchanged letters and ideas. Wiener was also a friend of the physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, and the two men often discussed their work.

Wiener was also a mentor to the computer scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky, who was a student of Wiener's at Harvard. Wiener was also a mentor to the mathematician and computer scientist John McCarthy, who was a student of Wiener's at MIT.

## Quotations

"The best material model of a living organism is another living organism." - Norbert Wiener

"The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself â€” not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity." - Norbert Wiener

"The world is an unpredictable and mysterious place. We can never know all the answers, but we can always strive to understand more." - Norbert Wiener

## Criticism and Controversy

Wiener's work was controversial in its time, and he was often criticized for his views on technology and its implications for humanity. He was also criticized for his views on the military-industrial complex, which he argued should be abolished.

Wiener was also criticized for his views on artificial intelligence, which he argued should be used for the benefit of humanity, not for its destruction. His views were seen as naive by some, and he was accused of being overly optimistic about the potential of technology.

## Digression

Wiener was a prolific writer, and he wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, including mathematics, philosophy, and politics. He was also a noted public speaker, and he often gave lectures on cybernetics and artificial intelligence.

Wiener was also a passionate advocate for social justice, and he was a vocal critic of racism and inequality. He was a strong supporter of civil rights, and he argued that technology should be used to promote equality and justice.

## Others

Wiener was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also a recipient of the National Medal of Science and the Turing Award. Wiener died in 1964 at the age of 69.
