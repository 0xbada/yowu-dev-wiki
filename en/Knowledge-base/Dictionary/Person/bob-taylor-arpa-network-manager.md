## Description

Bob Taylor was a computer scientist and manager of the ARPA Network (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) from 1966 to 1969. He was born in 1932 in Texas and received a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Texas.

Taylor was hired by ARPA in 1966 to manage the ARPA Network, a precursor to the modern Internet. He was responsible for overseeing the development of the network, which connected computers at various universities and research centers. He also worked on the development of the ARPANET Protocol, which allowed computers to communicate with each other.

Taylor's work on the ARPA Network was instrumental in the development of the modern Internet. He was also involved in the development of the first graphical user interface, which was used in the Xerox Alto computer.

Taylor left ARPA in 1969 and went on to work at Xerox PARC, where he worked on the development of the Alto computer and the Smalltalk programming language. He later worked at Digital Equipment Corporation, where he developed the DECnet network protocol.

Taylor was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2012 for his contributions to the development of the Internet. He passed away in 2017 at the age of 85.
