## Description
Bjarne Stroustrup is a Danish computer scientist, most famous for the creation and development of the C++ programming language. He is currently a professor and holder of the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science at Texas A&M University.

Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1979 while working at Bell Labs. He based the language on the C programming language, which he had been using since the early 1970s. He released the first version of C++ in 1985, and the language has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

Stroustrup has written several books on C++, including The C++ Programming Language, which is considered to be the definitive reference for the language. He is also a member of the ISO C++ standards committee, and has been involved in the development of the C++ standard since its inception.

## Life
Bjarne Stroustrup was born on 30 December 1950 in Aarhus, Denmark. He studied mathematics and computer science at the University of Aarhus, graduating in 1975. He then moved to the United Kingdom to study at the University of Cambridge, where he received a PhD in computer science in 1979.

In 1979, Stroustrup joined Bell Labs, where he began developing the C++ programming language. He released the first version of C++ in 1985, and the language has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

In 2002, Stroustrup joined the faculty of Texas A&M University, where he is currently a professor and holder of the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science.

## Career
Stroustrup's career has been focused on the development and promotion of the C++ programming language. He has written several books on the language, including The C++ Programming Language, which is considered to be the definitive reference for the language.

Stroustrup is also a member of the ISO C++ standards committee, and has been involved in the development of the C++ standard since its inception. He has also been involved in the development of other programming languages, such as Java and C#.

Stroustrup has received numerous awards for his work, including the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1993, the IEEE John von Neumann Medal in 2001, and the ACM Software System Award in 2004.

## Relationships with Celebrities
Stroustrup has had a long-standing relationship with Microsoft, which has been a major proponent of the C++ language. He has also been involved in the development of other programming languages, such as Java and C#.

Stroustrup has also had a long-standing relationship with the computer science community, and has been a frequent speaker at conferences and other events.

## Quotations
Stroustrup is well-known for his famous quote, "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows your whole leg off."

He is also known for his quote, "C++ is a language for serious programming. It's not just a toy."

## Criticism and Controversy
Stroustrup has been criticized for the complexity of the C++ language, which some argue has made it difficult for new programmers to learn.

He has also been criticized for his involvement in the development of the C++ standard, which some argue has been too slow and has resulted in a language that is too complex.

## Digression
Stroustrup is an avid sailor, and has competed in several sailing competitions. He is also an avid reader, and enjoys reading books on history, philosophy, and science.

## Others
Stroustrup is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He is also a member of the Royal Society of Arts.
