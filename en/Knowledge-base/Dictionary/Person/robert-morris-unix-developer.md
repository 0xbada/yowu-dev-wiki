# Description

Robert Morris is a computer scientist and UNIX developer who is best known for his work on the UNIX operating system. He is credited with creating the first version of the C programming language, and is also credited with creating the first version of the UNIX operating system.

Morris began his career in the late 1960s, when he was hired by Bell Labs to work on the UNIX operating system. He was responsible for developing the first version of the C programming language, which was used to create the UNIX operating system. He also developed the first version of the UNIX operating system, which was released in 1971.

In addition to his work on the UNIX operating system, Morris is also credited with creating the first version of the C programming language. He developed the language in 1972, and it quickly became the most popular programming language in the world.

Morris is also credited with creating the first version of the UNIX operating system. He developed the system in 1971, and it quickly became the most popular operating system in the world.

Morris has also been involved in a number of other projects, including the development of the first version of the X Window System, which is a graphical user interface for UNIX. He also developed the first version of the TCP/IP protocol, which is the foundation of the modern internet.

# Life

Robert Morris was born on October 28, 1945 in New York City. He grew up in a middle-class family, and attended public schools in the city. He was an excellent student, and was accepted to Harvard University in 1963.
