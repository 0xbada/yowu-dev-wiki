## Description
John Backus was an American computer scientist who is best known as the creator of FORTRAN, the first high-level programming language. He was born on December 3, 1924 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Harvard University, where he studied mathematics and physics.

In 1954, Backus joined IBM's Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory, where he worked on the development of FORTRAN. He and his team developed the language over the next two years, and it was released in 1957. FORTRAN was the first high-level programming language, and it revolutionized the way computers were programmed.

Backus was awarded the 1977 Turing Award for his work on FORTRAN, and he was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1991. He died on March 17, 2007 in Ashland, Oregon.

## Life
John Backus was born on December 3, 1924 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Harvard University, where he studied mathematics and physics. After graduating in 1945, he worked at the National Bureau of Standards and the Institute for Advanced Study.

In 1954, Backus joined IBM's Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory, where he worked on the development of FORTRAN. He and his team developed the language over the next two years, and it was released in 1957.

## Career
Backus's most famous contribution to computer science was the development of FORTRAN. He and his team at IBM developed the language over the next two years, and it was released in 1957. FORTRAN was the first high-level programming language, and it revolutionized the way computers were programmed.

Backus was also involved in the development of the ALGOL programming language, and he was a member of the team that developed the IBM 704 computer. He also wrote several books on computer science, including "The History of FORTRAN" and "Programming in FORTRAN".

## Relationships with Celebrities
Backus was a respected figure in the computer science community, and he was well-known among his peers. He was a member of the Association for Computing Machinery, and he was also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

## Quotations
Backus was known for his wit and wisdom. He once said, "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."

## Criticism and Controversy
Backus was criticized for his involvement in the development of the IBM 704 computer, which was designed to be used for military purposes. He was also criticized for his involvement in the development of the ALGOL programming language, which was seen as too complex for most programmers.

## Digression
Backus was an avid chess player, and he was a member of the Manhattan Chess Club. He was also an avid reader, and he was a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature.

## Others
Backus was awarded the 1977 Turing Award for his work on FORTRAN, and he was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1991. He died on March 17, 2007 in Ashland, Oregon.
