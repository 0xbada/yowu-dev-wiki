Ken Thompson is an American computer scientist and UNIX developer. He is best known for his work on the UNIX operating system and the C programming language. He was born on February 4, 1943 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Thompson attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied computer science. After graduating in 1966, he joined Bell Labs, where he worked on the Multics operating system. In 1969, he and Dennis Ritchie developed the UNIX operating system, which was designed to be a simpler and more efficient alternative to Multics.

Thompson is also credited with the development of the C programming language, which was designed to be a more efficient alternative to the existing programming languages of the time. He also developed the B programming language, which was the predecessor to C.

Thompson has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Turing Award, the National Medal of Technology, and the Japan Prize. He is also a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
