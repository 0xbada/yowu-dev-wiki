## Description
John Warnock is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur who is best known for co-founding Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982 and for creating the PostScript page description language. PostScript is a language used in the printing and display of vector graphics.

Warnock was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1940. He attended the University of Utah, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1965 and a master's degree in 1967, both in mathematics. He then went on to earn a PhD in computer science from the University of Utah in 1975.

Warnock began his career at Xerox PARC in 1975, where he worked on the Bravo word processor and the Interpress page description language. In 1982, he and Charles Geschke founded Adobe Systems Incorporated, which developed and marketed PostScript. PostScript was the first device-independent page description language, and it revolutionized the printing industry.

In addition to PostScript, Warnock and Geschke developed the Portable Document Format (PDF), which is a file format used to present documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.

Warnock retired from Adobe in 2000 and was succeeded by Bruce Chizen as CEO. He currently serves as chairman of the board of directors of Adobe Systems Incorporated.
