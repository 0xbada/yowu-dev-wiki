# Description

Robert Noyce (December 12, 1927 - June 3, 1990) was an American physicist and co-founder of Intel Corporation. He is widely credited as one of the inventors of the integrated circuit, which revolutionized the electronics industry and made possible the development of modern computing.

Noyce was born in Burlington, Iowa, and grew up in Grinnell, Iowa. He attended Grinnell College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1949. After graduating, he worked at Philco Corporation in Philadelphia, where he developed the first commercial integrated circuit.

In 1968, Noyce co-founded Intel Corporation with Gordon Moore and Andrew Grove. Intel quickly became the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductor chips, and Noyce served as its CEO from 1975 to 1979. He was also a major investor in Apple Computer, and served on its board of directors from 1978 to 1985.

Noyce was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1987, and the National Medal of Science in 1990. He died of a heart attack in 1990 at the age of 62.
