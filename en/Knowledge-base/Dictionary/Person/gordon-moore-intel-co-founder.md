# Description

Gordon Moore is an American businessman and co-founder of Intel Corporation. He was born on January 3, 1929 in San Francisco, California. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Physics.

In 1968, Moore co-founded Intel Corporation with Robert Noyce. Moore served as the company's CEO from 1975 to 1987 and as Chairman of the Board from 1979 to 1997. During his tenure, Intel became one of the world's largest semiconductor chip makers. Moore is credited with the invention of the integrated circuit, which revolutionized the electronics industry.

Moore is also known for his eponymous law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years. This law has been used to predict the future of the semiconductor industry and has been used to guide the development of new technologies.

Moore has been honored with numerous awards, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the IEEE Medal of Honor, and the National Medal of Science. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
