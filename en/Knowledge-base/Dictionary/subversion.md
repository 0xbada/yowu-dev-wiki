# Overview
Subversion (SVN) is a version control system that provides developers with a centralized repository to store and track changes to source code. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, easily revert to previous versions, and helps prevent conflicts when multiple developers are working on the same code.

# Description
Subversion (SVN) is a version control system that helps developers manage changes to their source code. It is an open-source system and is used for tracking changes to source code, managing source code releases, and collaborating with other developers. 

SVN stores all the changes to the source code in a centralized repository, which makes it easier for developers to track changes and collaborate on projects. It also allows developers to easily revert to previous versions of the code in case of errors or conflicts. 

SVN works by keeping track of all the changes made to the source code. Whenever a developer makes a change, the system stores a copy of the new version along with the old version, and creates a new revision. This allows developers to easily track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate on projects.

# Features
SVN has several features that make it an ideal version control system for developers. 

- **Centralized Repository:** SVN stores all the changes to the source code in a centralized repository, making it easier for developers to track changes and collaborate on projects. 
- **Versioning:** SVN keeps track of all the changes made to the source code, and creates a new revision each time a change is made. This makes it easy to track changes and revert to previous versions. 
- **Branching and Merging:** SVN allows developers to create branches of the source code, which makes it easier to work on different features without affecting the main codebase. It also allows developers to easily merge changes from different branches. 
- **Security:** SVN provides secure access to the repository, and allows developers to set access permissions for different users.

# Example
To demonstrate how SVN works, let’s say two developers, John and Jane, are working on a project. John creates a new branch of the source code and begins working on a new feature. Meanwhile, Jane is working on the main codebase. 

John makes some changes to the code and commits his changes to the repository. These changes are stored in a new revision and John’s branch is now updated with his changes. 

Jane also makes some changes to the main codebase and commits her changes to the repository. These changes are stored in a new revision and Jane’s branch is now updated with her changes. 

John and Jane can now merge their changes together and the repository will be updated with the combined changes.

# Pros and Cons
SVN has several advantages and disadvantages. 

**Pros:**
- Easy to use and manage
- Keeps track of changes and allows developers to easily revert to previous versions
- Allows developers to collaborate on projects
- Provides secure access to the repository

**Cons:**
- Not as fast as other version control systems
- Not suitable for large projects
- Can be difficult to learn for new developers

# Related Technology
Subversion is related to other version control systems, such as Git and Mercurial. These systems are similar to SVN in that they provide developers with a centralized repository to store and track changes to source code. However, they differ in their approach to version control, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
