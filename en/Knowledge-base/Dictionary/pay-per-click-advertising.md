# Overview
Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a form of online advertising where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. It is a way of buying visits to a website, rather than attempting to “earn” those visits organically. PPC is one of the most popular forms of digital advertising because it is cost-effective and can be tailored to specific audiences.

# Description
PPC advertising works by placing ads on search engine results pages (SERPs) and other websites. When a user clicks on an ad, the advertiser pays a fee to the search engine or website owner. This fee is usually based on the amount of competition for the keyword or phrase used in the ad.

The most popular form of PPC advertising is Google Ads, which is a pay-per-click advertising platform run by Google. Other popular PPC platforms include Microsoft Ads, Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Facebook Ads.

PPC campaigns are typically managed by a PPC specialist or agency. The specialist will create ads, select keywords, and set a budget. The budget is based on the cost-per-click (CPC) of the chosen keywords. The CPC is determined by the amount of competition for the keyword or phrase.

# History
PPC advertising was first introduced in 1998 by Goto.com (now known as Overture). Goto.com was the first company to use an auction-based system to determine the cost of an ad placement. This system was later adopted by Google and other search engines.

Since then, PPC advertising has become a popular form of online advertising. It has been used by large companies to reach new customers and by small businesses to increase their online visibility.

# Features
PPC advertising offers several advantages over other forms of online advertising. First, it is cost-effective, as advertisers only pay when their ad is clicked. This makes it a great option for businesses with limited budgets.

Second, PPC advertising is highly targeted. Advertisers can target specific audiences based on demographics, interests, and other factors. This allows them to reach the right people with the right message.

Third, PPC advertising is highly measurable. Advertisers can track the performance of their campaigns in real-time and make adjustments as needed.

Finally, PPC advertising is relatively easy to set up and manage. Advertisers can set up campaigns quickly and manage them with minimal effort.

# Example
An example of a PPC campaign is a business selling outdoor furniture. The business could create an ad targeting people interested in outdoor furniture. The ad could appear on SERPs when users search for “outdoor furniture” or related terms. When a user clicks on the ad, the business would pay a fee to the search engine.

# Pros and Cons
PPC advertising has several advantages over other forms of online advertising. It is cost-effective, highly targeted, and easy to set up and manage. However, it can also be expensive if not managed correctly.

# Controversy
PPC advertising has been the subject of some controversy. Critics argue that it can be used to manipulate search engine results, as advertisers can bid on keywords to get their ads to appear higher in the SERPs.

# Related Technology
PPC advertising is related to other forms of online advertising, such as display advertising, social media advertising, and affiliate marketing. It is also related to search engine optimization (SEO), which is the process of optimizing a website for better visibility in search engine results.

# Digression
PPC advertising is often confused with cost-per-impression (CPM) advertising, which is a form of online advertising where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is displayed. However, CPM advertising is different from PPC advertising in that advertisers do not pay for each click.

# Others
PPC advertising is an effective way to reach new customers and increase sales. However, it is important to understand how it works and manage campaigns carefully to ensure they are successful.
