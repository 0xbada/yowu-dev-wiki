# Overview
Project Management is the process of planning, organizing, and managing resources to achieve a specific goal. It involves managing the project from conception to completion, including all the activities that need to be completed within a given timeframe, budget, and quality standards. Project Management is often used to manage the development of IT projects, such as software development, website design, and network infrastructure. 

## History
Project Management has been used since the 1950s, when it was initially developed to manage large-scale engineering and construction projects. By the mid-1970s, the use of Project Management had spread to other industries, including IT. In the 1980s, the Project Management Institute (PMI) was founded, and it published the first version of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). 

## Description
Project Management is a systematic approach to managing the resources, tasks, and goals of a project. Project Managers are responsible for planning, organizing, and controlling the overall progress of the project, and they typically use software tools to help manage the project. The most commonly used Project Management tool is the Gantt chart, which is used to visualize the timeline and progress of a project.

Project Management typically follows the following steps: 

1. **Define the Project Scope** – The first step is to define the project scope, which includes the goals, objectives, budget, timeline, and deliverables.

2. **Create a Project Plan** – The Project Manager must create a detailed plan that outlines the tasks, resources, and timeline for the project.

3. **Manage Resources** – The Project Manager must identify and secure the necessary resources for the project, such as personnel, materials, and equipment.

4. **Monitor Progress** – The Project Manager must monitor the progress of the project and take corrective action if necessary.

5. **Evaluate Results** – The Project Manager must evaluate the results of the project and determine if the project was successful.

## Digression
Project Management is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the project, its objectives, and the resources available. It is important for Project Managers to have strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as an understanding of the technical aspects of the project.
