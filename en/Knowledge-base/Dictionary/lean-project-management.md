# Overview
Lean project management is an approach to managing projects that emphasizes eliminating waste and optimizing efficiency. It is based on the principles of the Lean methodology, which was originally developed in the automotive industry to reduce costs and improve quality. Lean project management focuses on reducing waste, increasing collaboration, and improving the speed of delivery.

# Description
Lean project management is an approach to managing projects that emphasizes eliminating waste and optimizing efficiency. It is based on the principles of the Lean methodology, which was originally developed in the automotive industry to reduce costs and improve quality. Lean project management focuses on reducing waste, increasing collaboration, and improving the speed of delivery.

The goal of Lean project management is to reduce waste and optimize the efficiency of projects. This is done by focusing on the value of the project, rather than on the process itself. Lean project management emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.

The core principles of Lean project management include:

- Eliminating waste: Lean project management focuses on eliminating waste and streamlining processes. This includes reducing the amount of time spent on non-value-adding activities and eliminating unnecessary steps.

- Increasing collaboration: Lean project management encourages collaboration between team members and stakeholders. This includes open communication and shared goals.

- Improving speed of delivery: Lean project management focuses on delivering projects quickly. This includes reducing the amount of time required to complete tasks, as well as reducing the amount of time spent on rework.

- Continuous improvement: Lean project management emphasizes a culture of continuous improvement. This includes regularly assessing the effectiveness of processes and making changes to improve efficiency.

# History
The Lean methodology was originally developed in the automotive industry in the 1940s. It was designed to reduce costs and improve quality. Over time, the Lean methodology was adopted by other industries, including software development and project management.

In the early 2000s, the principles of Lean were applied to project management. This led to the development of Lean project management, which focuses on eliminating waste and optimizing efficiency.

# Features
The features of Lean project management include:

- Eliminating waste: Lean project management focuses on eliminating waste and streamlining processes. This includes reducing the amount of time spent on non-value-adding activities and eliminating unnecessary steps.

- Increasing collaboration: Lean project management encourages collaboration between team members and stakeholders. This includes open communication and shared goals.

- Improving speed of delivery: Lean project management focuses on delivering projects quickly. This includes reducing the amount of time required to complete tasks, as well as reducing the amount of time spent on rework.

- Continuous improvement: Lean project management emphasizes a culture of continuous improvement. This includes regularly assessing the effectiveness of processes and making changes to improve efficiency.

# Example
An example of Lean project management in action is a project to develop a new software application. The project team would use Lean principles to reduce waste and optimize efficiency. This could include reducing the amount of time spent on non-value-adding activities, eliminating unnecessary steps, and improving collaboration between team members and stakeholders.

# Pros and Cons
