# Overview
Performance Testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the performance of software under a given workload. It is used to identify and resolve any issues that might affect the performance of software, including reliability, scalability, and user experience. Performance Testing can be conducted manually, using a variety of tools, or using automation frameworks. 

# History
Performance Testing is a relatively new concept, with its roots in the early 2000s, when software developers began to recognize the need to evaluate the performance of software before releasing it to the public. Since then, Performance Testing has been used to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of software, and is now an integral part of the software development process. 

# Description
Performance Testing is a process that is used to evaluate the performance of software under a given workload. It is designed to measure the response time, throughput, reliability, scalability, and user experience of a software system. To perform Performance Testing, a set of predetermined tests are conducted, and the results are then analyzed to identify any issues that may affect the performance of the software. 

Performance Testing can be conducted manually, using a variety of tools, or using automation frameworks. Manual Performance Testing involves manually executing tests, and then analyzing the results. Tools such as JMeter, LoadRunner, and WebLoad can be used to automate the process of executing tests and collecting data. Automation frameworks such as Selenium WebDriver can also be used to automate the process of testing. 

# Pros and Cons 
Performance Testing has several advantages and disadvantages. 

Advantages: 
- Identify and resolve performance issues before deployment
- Ensure the reliability and scalability of the software
- Improve the user experience of the software
- Reduce the cost of maintenance and support

Disadvantages: 
- Time-consuming and costly
- Requires specialized skills and tools 
- Not all performance issues can be identified
