## Overview
Stakeholder management is a critical component of IT development, as it involves the identification, analysis, and management of stakeholders in order to ensure successful project delivery. Stakeholders can be internal and external, ranging from management and customers to suppliers and subcontractors. This article provides an overview of stakeholder management, including its importance, how it works, and the different types of stakeholders. 

## Description
Stakeholder management involves understanding, engaging, and managing the expectations of stakeholders in order to ensure successful project delivery. It is important for IT development teams to be able to identify and manage the expectations of the various stakeholders in order to ensure the project's success. By engaging stakeholders and managing expectations, teams can ensure that their project will be successful and meet the stakeholders' needs.

It is important for IT development teams to identify all stakeholders in the project, including internal and external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders include management, customers, employees, and subcontractors, while external stakeholders include suppliers, partners, and the public. Once stakeholders have been identified, it is important to analyze their interests and needs in order to better understand their expectations. 

Stakeholder management also involves managing the expectations of stakeholders. This involves understanding the stakeholders' interests and needs, as well as working with them to ensure that their expectations are met. It is important to engage stakeholders throughout the project in order to identify potential issues and resolve any conflicts that may arise. 

## Example
For example, consider a project that requires the cooperation of both internal and external stakeholders. In this case, it is important to identify all stakeholders and understand their interests and needs. This may include engaging with management to understand the goals of the project and engaging with suppliers to ensure that their resources are available. Additionally, it is important to engage with employees and subcontractors to ensure that their expectations are met and any conflicts are resolved. 

Finally, it is important to manage the expectations of all stakeholders throughout the project. This may involve making sure that the project meets the stakeholders' expectations, communication any changes or delays, and resolving conflicts that may arise. 

## Pros and Cons
Stakeholder management is an important component of IT development, as it involves understanding, engaging, and managing the expectations of stakeholders in order to ensure successful project delivery. There are several advantages to stakeholder management, including: 

* Improved communication – By engaging with stakeholders and understanding their interests and needs, it is possible to improve communication and ensure that expectations are managed properly.
* Improved project delivery – By engaging with stakeholders and managing their expectations, it is possible to ensure that the project meets their needs and is delivered on time and on budget.
* Improved customer satisfaction – By understanding the needs of stakeholders and engaging with them, it is possible to ensure that the project meets their needs and increases customer satisfaction.

However, there are also some disadvantages to stakeholder management. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be time consuming and require a lot of effort to ensure that all stakeholders are engaged and their expectations managed properly. Additionally, it can be difficult to manage the expectations of stakeholders who have conflicting interests.
