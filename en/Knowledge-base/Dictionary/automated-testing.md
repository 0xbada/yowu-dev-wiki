# Overview
Automated testing is a process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors. It is used to compare the expected output with the actual output to ensure that the system is working as expected. Automated testing is a valuable tool for software development teams, as it speeds up the testing process and reduces the amount of manual effort required to ensure quality.

# Description
Automated testing is a process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors. It is used to compare the expected output with the actual output to ensure that the system is working as expected. Automated tests can be written in various scripting languages, such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java.

The automated testing process begins with the creation of test cases. These test cases are used to define the expected behavior of the system. Once the test cases are written, they are executed against the system. The results of the test cases are then compared to the expected results. If there are any discrepancies between the expected and actual results, the test case is marked as a failure.

The automated testing process can be divided into two main parts: functional testing and non-functional testing. Functional testing is used to verify that the system is performing as expected, while non-functional testing is used to verify the system's performance.

Automated testing is a valuable tool for software development teams, as it speeds up the testing process and reduces the amount of manual effort required to ensure quality. Automated tests can be used to quickly identify and fix issues with the system, as well as to ensure that new features are working as expected. Additionally, automated tests can be used to detect regressions, which are changes to the system that cause existing features to break.

# History
Automated testing has been used in software development for decades. In the early days, automated tests were written using scripting languages, such as Tcl, Perl, and Visual Basic. In the late 1990s, the open source tool Selenium was released, which enabled developers to write automated tests using web browsers.

In the 2000s, automated testing tools such as Cucumber and JUnit were released, which enabled developers to write automated tests in a more structured manner. In recent years, the popularity of automated testing has increased, as it has become an essential tool for software development teams.

# Features
Automated testing has several features that make it a valuable tool for software development teams.

- Automated tests are repeatable: Automated tests can be run multiple times, ensuring that the system is performing as expected.

- Automated tests are faster: Automated tests can be run quickly, reducing the amount of time required to test the system.

- Automated tests are more accurate: Automated tests can detect subtle changes in the system, which would be difficult to detect manually.

- Automated tests are easier to maintain: Automated tests can be updated easily, ensuring that tests remain up-to-date with the system.

# Example
An example of an automated test is a unit test. A unit test is a type of automated test that is used to verify the behavior of a single unit of code, such as a function or class. Unit tests are typically written using a unit testing framework, such as JUnit or NUnit.

# Pros and Cons
Automated testing has several advantages and disadvantages.

Pros:

- Automated tests are repeatable: Automated tests can be run multiple times, ensuring that the system is performing as expected.

- Automated tests are faster: Automated tests can be run quickly, reducing the amount of time required to test the system.

- Automated tests are more accurate: Automated tests can detect subtle changes in the system, which would be difficult to detect manually.

Cons:

- Automated tests can be difficult to write: Writing automated tests can be a time-consuming process, as it requires a deep understanding of the system.

- Automated tests can be brittle: Automated tests can be easily broken if the system changes, requiring the tests to be updated.

- Automated tests can be expensive: Automated tests require significant resources, such as hardware and software, to run.

# Related Technology
Automated testing is closely related to other testing technologies, such as unit testing and integration testing. Unit testing is a type of automated testing that is used to verify the behavior of a single unit of code, such as a function or class. Integration testing is a type of automated testing that is used to verify the behavior of multiple units of code, such as a system or application.
