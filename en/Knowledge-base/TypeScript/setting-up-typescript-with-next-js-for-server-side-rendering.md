# Setting Up TypeScript with Next.js for Server-Side Rendering

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components. And it can be used with React for server-side rendering (SSR).

In this article, we'll show you how to set up TypeScript with Next.js. We'll go over some of the benefits of using TypeScript with Next.js and show you how to get started.

## Why Use TypeScript with Next.js?

There are several benefits to using TypeScript with Next.js.

TypeScript can help you catch errors early. This is because TypeScript is a typed language, which means that you can specify the types of variables, functions, and so on. This can help you avoid errors that would otherwise go undetected until runtime.

TypeScript can also make your code more readable and maintainable. This is because you can use TypeScript's type annotations to document the types of variables, functions, and so on. This makes it easier for other developers to understand your code.

Another benefit of using TypeScript with Next.js is that it can improve your development workflow. This is because the TypeScript compiler can check your code for errors as you're working on it. This can save you a lot of time compared to waiting for your code to compile before you can test it.

## Getting Started

Now that we've gone over some of the benefits of using TypeScript with Next.js, let's get started.

First, make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed. Then, create a new directory for your project.

Next, initialize your project with TypeScript. You can do this by running the following command:

```
$ tsc --init
```

This will create a tsconfig.json file in your project. This file contains the TypeScript configuration for your project.

Next, create a new file called next.config.js in your project. This file contains the Next.js configuration for your project.

Next, add the following code to your next.config.js file:

```js
const withTypeScript = require('@zeit/next-typescript');

module.exports = withTypeScript();
```

This will configure Next.js to use TypeScript.

Next, create a new file called pages/index.tsx in your project. This file contains the React code for your project.

Add the following code to your pages/index.tsx file:

```js
import * as React from 'react';

export default class extends React.Component {
  static getInitialProps({ req }) {
    const userAgent = req ? req.headers['user-agent'] : navigator.userAgent;
    return { userAgent };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Hello, world!
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This code will render a simple "Hello, world!" message.

Finally, start your development server by running the following command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

You should now see your "Hello, world!" message displayed in your browser.
