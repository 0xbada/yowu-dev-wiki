# Combining Nest.js, Express.js, and Next.js for Full-Stack Development

The rise of Node.js has led to the rise of full-stack JavaScript development. This has made it possible to develop applications using a single language, making the development process more efficient. In this article, we'll look at how to combine Nest.js, Express.js, and Next.js to create a full-stack JavaScript application.

## What is Nest.js?

Nest.js is a framework for building server-side applications. It is built on top of Node.js and Express.js, and it uses TypeScript. Nest.js is a great choice for building server-side applications. It is easy to use, and it has a lot of features.

## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It is the most popular Node.js framework, and it is used by a lot of companies, such as Uber, Airbnb, and Twitter. Express.js is a great choice for building web applications. It is easy to use, and it has a lot of features.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework for building server-side applications. It is built on top of React, and it uses TypeScript. Next.js is a great choice for building server-side applications. It is easy to use, and it has a lot of features.

## How to Combine Nest.js, Express.js, and Next.js?

There are two ways to combine Nest.js, Express.js, and Next.js. The first way is to use the Nest.js framework to build the server-side application, and the second way is to use the Next.js framework to build the server-side application.

### Using Nest.js to Build the Server-Side Application

To use Nest.js to build the server-side application, you need to install the following dependencies:

```
npm install --save @nestjs/core @nestjs/common express
```

Then, you need to create a file named `main.ts` in the `src` directory, and you need to add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { ApplicationModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

Next, you need to create a file named `app.module.ts` in the `src` directory, and you need to add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

Then, you need to create a file named `app.controller.ts` in the `src` directory, and you need to add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  root() {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

Finally, you need to create a file named `app.service.ts` in the `src` directory, and you need to add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

Now, you can run the application using the following command:

```
npm start
```

You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

### Using Next.js to Build the Server-Side Application

To use Next.js to build the server-side application, you need to install the following dependencies:

```
npm install --save next react react-dom
```

Then, you need to create a file named `next.config.js` in the root directory, and you need to add the following code to it:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless',
};
```

Next, you need to create a file named `pages/index.js` in the `src` directory, and you need to add the following code to it:

```javascript
export default () => 'Hello World!';
```

Now, you can run the application using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

In this article, we've looked at how to combine Nest.js, Express.js, and Next.js to create a full-stack JavaScript application. We've also looked at how to use Nest.js and Next.js to build the server-side application.
