# Using TypeScript with Passport.js for User Authentication

Passport.js is a flexible authentication middleware for Node.js. It can be used to authenticate users using a variety of strategies, including username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type-checking and other features. TypeScript is widely used in large applications, and its support for modules, classes, and interfaces makes it a good choice for working with Passport.js.

In this article, we'll look at how to use TypeScript with Passport.js to build a user authentication system. We'll start by setting up a project with TypeScript and Express.js. Then we'll install Passport.js and configure it for use with TypeScript. Finally, we'll add some TypeScript code to implement a simple username and password authentication strategy.

## Setting up a TypeScript Project

To get started, we need to create a new TypeScript project. We'll use the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) web framework and the [TypeScript Node Starter](https://github.com/ Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) project template.

First, install the TypeScript compiler and the Express.js framework. We'll also need a few other modules:

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install express
npm install @types/express -D
```

Next, create a new project using the TypeScript Node Starter template:

```
npx tsc --init
```

This will create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project. Open this file and add the following settings:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es6",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "outDir": "dist",
        "strict": true
    }
}
```

These settings will compile our TypeScript code to ES6 JavaScript, which is compatible with Express.js. The compiled code will be output to the `dist` directory.

## Installing Passport.js

Now that we have a project set up, we can install Passport.js. Run the following command:

```
npm install passport
```

This will install the Passport.js module and add it to the `package.json` file.

## Configuring Passport.js

Passport.js uses a modular approach, with different "strategies" for authenticating users. There are strategies for authenticating with a username and password, with Facebook, with Twitter, and more. In this article, we'll focus on the username and password authentication strategy.

To use a Passport.js strategy, we need to install the corresponding module. For the username and password strategy, we'll use the [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) module. Run the following command to install it:

```
npm install passport-local
```

Once the module is installed, we need to configure Passport.js to use it. We'll do this in the `app.ts` file. First, we need to import the `passport-local` module:

```javascript
import passportLocal from "passport-local";
```

Next, we need to configure Passport.js to use the `passport-local` strategy. We'll do this in the `configurePassport` function:

```javascript
function configurePassport(passport: passport.Passport) {
    passport.use(new passportLocal.Strategy());
}
```

This configures Passport.js to use the `passport-local` strategy. The `passport-local` strategy authenticates users using a username and password.

## Implementing Authentication

Now that we have Passport.js configured, we can start implementing authentication. We'll do this in the `app.ts` file.

First, we need to import the `passport-local` module:

```javascript
import passportLocal from "passport-local";
```

Next, we need to configure Passport.js to use the `passport-local` strategy. We'll do this in the `configurePassport` function:

```javascript
function configurePassport(passport: passport.Passport) {
    passport.use(new passportLocal.Strategy());
}
```

This configures Passport.js to use the `passport-local` strategy. The `passport-local` strategy authenticates users using a username and password.

Once we have Passport.js configured, we can write the code to authenticate a user. We'll do this in the `login` function:

```javascript
async function login(req: express.Request, res: express.Response) {
    passport.authenticate("local", (err, user, info) => {
        if (err) {
            // Handle errors
        }

        if (!user) {
            // Redirect to login page
        }

        // Login successful, redirect to home page
    })(req, res);
}
```

This code authenticates a user using the `passport-local` strategy. If the authentication is successful, the user will be redirected to the home page. Otherwise, they will be redirected to the login page.
