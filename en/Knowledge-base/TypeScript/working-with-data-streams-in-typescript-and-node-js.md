# Introduction

In this article, we'll be looking at how to work with data streams in TypeScript and Node.js. We'll cover the different types of stream available in Node.js, how to create them, and how to use them to work with data.

Node.js streams are powerful tools that can help you to work with data more efficiently. Streams can be used to read and write data, and can be chained together to perform complex operations on data.

There are four main types of streams available in Node.js: readable, writable, duplex, and transform. Readable streams allow you to read data from a source, writable streams allow you to write data to a destination, duplex streams allow you to read and write data, and transform streams allow you to modify data as it is being read or written.

In this article, we'll be focusing on the first two types of stream: readable and writable. We'll look at how to create readable and writable streams, and how to use them to read and write data.

# Creating Readable Streams

There are a few different ways to create readable streams in Node.js. The simplest way is to use the `fs.createReadStream()` method:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/file');
```

This method takes a path to a file as its only argument, and returns a readable stream that can be used to read the contents of the file.

Another way to create a readable stream is to use the `net.createServer()` method:

```javascript
const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  // socket is a readable stream
});
```

This method creates a TCP server, and returns a readable stream that can be used to read data from the server.

# Creating Writable Streams

Writable streams can be created using the `fs.createWriteStream()` method:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/file');
```

This method takes a path to a file as its only argument, and returns a writable stream that can be used to write data to the file.

Another way to create a writable stream is to use the `net.createServer()` method:

```javascript
const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  // socket is a writable stream
});
```

This method creates a TCP server, and returns a writable stream that can be used to write data to the server.

# Reading from Readable Streams

Once you have created a readable stream, you can start reading data from it using the `read()` method:

```javascript
readableStream.read();
```

This method reads data from the stream and returns it as a string.

If there is no data available to be read, the `read()` method will return `null`.

# Writing to Writable Streams

Once you have created a writable stream, you can start writing data to it using the `write()` method:

```javascript
writableStream.write('some data');
```

This method writes data to the stream. The data can be a string or a buffer.

# Piping Streams Together

One of the most powerful features of Node.js streams is the ability to pipe streams together.

Piping allows you to connect two or more streams together so that the data from one stream is automatically sent to the other stream.

For example, you could pipe a readable stream to a writable stream:

```javascript
readableStream.pipe(writableStream);
```

This would cause the data from the readable stream to be written to the writable stream.

You can also pipe multiple streams together. For example, you could pipe a readable stream to a transform stream, and then pipe the transform stream to a writable stream:

```javascript
readableStream
  .pipe(transformStream)
  .pipe(writableStream);
```

This would cause the data from the readable stream to be transformed by the transform stream, and then written to the writable stream.
