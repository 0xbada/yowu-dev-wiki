# Using AWS and Azure for Edge Computing and IoT Workloads

## What is edge computing?

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm which brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve performance and responsiveness. It involves moving computationally intensive or latency-sensitive tasks away from centralized nodes to nodes at or near the edge of the network.

## Why use edge computing?

The benefits of edge computing include improved performance, reduced latency, increased security, and reduced bandwidth costs.

## How can AWS and Azure be used for edge computing?

AWS and Azure both offer services for edge computing.

### AWS

AWS offers a range of services for edge computing, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon CloudFront, and AWS Lambda@Edge.

### Azure

Azure offers a range of services for edge computing, including Azure IoT Edge, Azure Functions, and Azure Container Instances.

## What are some considerations for using edge computing?

Some considerations for using edge computing include the following:

- Latency: Edge computing can help to reduce latency by moving computation closer to the data source.
- Security: Edge computing can help to improve security by reducing the attack surface and avoiding single points of failure.
- Bandwidth: Edge computing can help to reduce bandwidth costs by avoiding the need to send data to and from a central location.

## Conclusion

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm which can offer improved performance, reduced latency, increased security, and reduced bandwidth costs. AWS and Azure both offer services for edge computing. Some considerations for using edge computing include latency, security, and bandwidth.
