# AWS Polly: Generating Speech from Text with Text-to-Speech Technology

Text-to-speech (TTS) technology converts text into natural-sounding speech. It can be used to help you read text, or to create lifelike voices for your characters in games or videos. TTS technology is also being used to create audio books, or to provide audio descriptions of images for people who are blind or have low vision.

AWS Polly is a TTS service that uses deep learning algorithms to convert text into lifelike speech. Polly supports multiple languages and voices, so you can create speech in your own language or in another language.

Polly is easy to use. You simply send the text you want to convert to speech to the Polly API, and Polly converts it into an audio file that you can download or play back in your application.

Polly is a scalable TTS service that can handle high volumes of traffic. You can use Polly to create speech at scale, without having to worry about capacity planning or managing server infrastructure.

## How does Polly work?

Polly uses a deep learning algorithm to convert text into speech. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of real human speech, so it can learn to mimic the patterns of human speech.

Polly supports multiple languages and voices. Each voice has its own set of characteristics, such as pitch, speed, and accent. You can select a voice that is appropriate for your application.

Polly converts text into speech one word at a time. It first breaks the text down into a series of phonemes, and then maps the phonemes to the corresponding sounds in the selected voice.

Polly can generate speech from text in real time, or it can generate speech from text that has been pre-recorded.

## What are the benefits of using Polly?

Polly has a number of benefits over traditional TTS systems:

- **Natural sounding speech:** Polly uses deep learning algorithms to generate speech that sounds natural and human-like.

- **Support for multiple languages and voices:** Polly supports a wide range of languages and voices, so you can create speech in your own language or in another language.

- **Scalable:** Polly is a scalable TTS service that can handle high volumes of traffic. You can use Polly to create speech at scale, without having to worry about capacity planning or managing server infrastructure.

## What are the drawbacks of using Polly?

Polly is not perfect. Here are some of the drawbacks of using Polly:

- **Accuracy:** Polly is not 100% accurate. The deep learning algorithm that Polly uses to generate speech is not perfect, and it will sometimes make mistakes.

- **Cost:** Polly is a pay-as-you-go service, so you will be charged for the number of characters that you convert to speech.

- **Latency:** Polly takes time to generate speech. The amount of time it takes will depend on the length of the text and the complexity of the algorithms used.

## How much does Polly cost?

Polly is a pay-as-you-go service. You will be charged for the number of characters that you convert to speech. The price depends on the voice that you select and the region where you are using Polly.

## How do I get started with Polly?

To get started with Polly, you first need to create an AWS account. Then, you can create a Polly voice using the AWS Management Console.

Once you have created a voice, you can use the Polly API to convert text to speech. The Polly API is a web service that you can call from your own application.

## What are some of the use cases for Polly?

Polly can be used for a wide range of applications, including:

- **Text-to-speech:** You can use Polly to convert text into speech. This can be used to create audio books, or to provide audio descriptions of images for people who are blind or have low vision.

- **Speech-to-text:** You can use Polly to convert speech into text. This can be used to create transcripts of speeches, or to create captions for videos.

- **Immersive experiences:** You can use Polly to create lifelike voices for your characters in games or videos.
