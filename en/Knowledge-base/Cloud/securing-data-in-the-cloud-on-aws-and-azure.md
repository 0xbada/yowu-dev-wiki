# Securing Data in the Cloud on AWS and Azure

The cloud has become the default option for businesses seeking to take advantage of its many benefits, including scalability, flexibility, and cost savings. However, with these benefits come security risks that must be managed in order to protect sensitive data. In this article, we'll take a look at how to secure data in the cloud on AWS and Azure.

## AWS

AWS provides a number of services to help secure data in the cloud, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), Key Management Service (KMS), and CloudTrail.

### Identity and Access Management

IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. IAM lets you create and manage users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge.

IAM is a critical component of security in the AWS cloud. It gives you fine-grained control over which users have access to which AWS resources, and what actions they can perform on those resources. IAM also enables you to create and manage users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

### Key Management Service

KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. KMS is a secure and convenient way to manage the keys used to encrypt your data. KMS provides a centralized control point for the creation, rotation, and deletion of keys, and for the monitoring and auditing of key usage.

### CloudTrail

CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for your account, including API calls made via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. CloudTrail enables you to monitor, control, and audit user activity in your AWS account.

## Azure

Azure provides a number of services to help secure data in the cloud, including Azure Active Directory (AD), Azure Storage, and Azure Key Vault.

### Azure Active Directory

Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD provides a central location for managing user identities and access to Azure resources. Azure AD also enables you to extend your on-premises Active Directory to the cloud, giving you a single identity infrastructure for your hybrid cloud.
