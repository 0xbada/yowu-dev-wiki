* **Publish**: Publish the chatbot to Azure.

## Deploying the chat application to Azure

Deploying the chatbot to Azure is a two-step process. First, you need to create a web app in Azure and then deploy the chatbot to that web app.

To create a web app in Azure, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, click **Create a resource**.

3. In the **Search the Marketplace** field, enter "web app" and press Enter.

6. On the **Create** page, enter the following information:

* **Name**: Enter a name for your web app.

* **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.

* **Resource group**: Select an existing resource group or create a new one.

* **OS**: Select the operating system for your web app.

* **Runtime stack**: Select the runtime stack for your web app.

* **Region**: Select the region for your web app.

* **Application insights**: Select whether to create a new Application Insights resource or use an existing one.

7. Click **Create**.

Your web app will be created in Azure.

To deploy the chatbot to the web app, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on the chatbot that you want to deploy.

3. In the chatbot's overview page, click on the **Deploy** button.
