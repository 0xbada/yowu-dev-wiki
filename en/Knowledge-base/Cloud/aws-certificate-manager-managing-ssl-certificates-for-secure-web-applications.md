# AWS Certificate Manager: Managing SSL Certificates for Secure Web Applications

The AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a user-friendly, cost-effective way to manage SSL/TLS certificates for web applications that are hosted on AWS. ACM provides a wide range of benefits, including the following:

- **Security**: ACM uses AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (CA), which is a highly available and scalable private CA service that is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). ACM Private CA provides you with a private CA that you can use to issue certificates that are internal to your organization.

- **Ease of use**: ACM makes it easy to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for your web applications. With ACM, you can request a certificate, deploy it on AWS resources, and renew it with just a few clicks.

- **Low cost**: ACM provides free SSL/TLS certificates for use on AWS resources, and you pay only for the AWS resources that you use to deploy your certificates.

## What Is an SSL/TLS Certificate?

An SSL/TLS certificate is a digital certificate that uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt communication between a web server and a web browser. SSL/TLS certificates are typically used to secure web traffic and to authenticate web servers.

## How Does ACM Work?

ACM provides a unified experience for managing SSL/TLS certificates for your web applications across multiple AWS services. ACM integrates with AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon API Gateway to provide you with a seamless experience for provisioning, deploying, and renewing certificates.

ACM also makes it easy to import third-party SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS resources. You can use the AWS Certificate Manager console to request a certificate, deploy it on AWS resources, and renew it with just a few clicks.

## Benefits of Using ACM

ACM provides a number of benefits for managing SSL/TLS certificates for your web applications, including the following:

- **Security**: ACM uses AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (CA), which is a highly available and scalable private CA service that is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). ACM Private CA provides you with a private CA that you can use to issue certificates that are internal to your organization.

- **Low cost**: ACM provides free SSL/TLS certificates for use on AWS resources, and you pay only for the AWS resources that you use to deploy your certificates.

## How to Get Started with ACM

To get started with ACM, simply create an AWS account and then sign in to the ACM console. From there, you can request a certificate, deploy it on AWS resources, and renew it with just a few clicks.

If you have an existing SSL/TLS certificate that you want to use with AWS resources, you can import it into ACM. You can also use ACM to generate a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.

## Conclusion

ACM is a user-friendly, cost-effective way to manage SSL/TLS certificates for your web applications. ACM provides a number of benefits, including security, ease of use, and low cost. To get started with ACM, simply create an AWS account and then sign in to the ACM console.
