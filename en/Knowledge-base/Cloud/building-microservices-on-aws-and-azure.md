# Building Microservices on AWS and Azure

With the growth of cloud computing, more and more businesses are moving towards distributed architectures. This means that instead of having one large monolithic application, the application is broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces called microservices.

There are many benefits to using microservices, including the ability to deploy and scale individual services independently, and the fact that each service can be written in a different language.

However, microservices can also be complex to set up and manage. In this article, we'll take a look at two of the most popular cloud platforms for hosting microservices - Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

## Amazon Web Services

AWS offers a number of services that are well-suited to microservices.

### Elastic Container Service

The Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a managed container orchestration service. This means that it can be used to run, manage, and scale containerized applications.

ECS is a great option for running microservices because it offers high levels of performance and scalability. Plus, it integrates with a number of other AWS services, making it easy to set up a complete microservices architecture on AWS.

### Lambda

Lambda is a serverless computing platform. This means that you can run code without having to provision or manage any servers.

Lambda is a great option for microservices because it can be used to trigger other AWS services in response to events. For example, you could use Lambda to resize images or process payments when a user submits an order.

### Amazon API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a service that can be used to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.

API Gateway is a great option for microservices because it makes it easy to create and manage APIs. Plus, it offers a number of features that can be used to secure and scale APIs.

## Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure offers a number of services that are well-suited to microservices.

### Azure Container Service

The Azure Container Service (ACS) is a managed container orchestration service. This means that it can be used to run, manage, and scale containerized applications.

ACS is a great option for running microservices because it offers high levels of performance and scalability. Plus, it integrates with a number of other Azure services, making it easy to set up a complete microservices architecture on Azure.

### Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless computing platform. This means that you can run code without having to provision or manage any servers.

Azure Functions is a great option for microservices because it can be used to trigger other Azure services in response to events. For example, you could use Azure Functions to resize images or process payments when a user submits an order.

### Azure API Management

Azure API Management is a service that can be used to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.

API Management is a great option for microservices because it makes it easy to create and manage APIs. Plus, it offers a number of features that can be used to secure and scale APIs.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've looked at two of the most popular cloud platforms for hosting microservices - Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

We've also seen that each platform offers a number of services that are well-suited to microservices. So, if you're planning on building a microservices architecture, then AWS or Azure is a great place to start.
