# Best Practices for Cloud DevOps on AWS and Azure

The cloud has become the new normal for IT infrastructure and development. Development teams are adopting DevOps practices to accelerate the delivery of cloud-native applications.

There are many cloud providers to choose from, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are two of the most popular. Both offer a wide range of services and products, and both are constantly innovating to keep up with the latest trends in cloud computing.

When it comes to DevOps on AWS and Azure, there are some best practices that will help your team be successful.

## Use the Right Tools for the Job

AWS and Azure each have a wide range of tools and services that can be used for DevOps. It's important to choose the right tools for the job, and not try to force a square peg into a round hole.

For example, AWS offers a service called CodePipeline that can be used for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). CodePipeline is a great tool for AWS-native applications, but it might not be the best choice for applications that are deployed to multiple cloud providers. In that case, a tool like Jenkins might be a better choice.

## Automate Everything

One of the key benefits of DevOps is the ability to automate repetitive tasks. This not only saves time, but it also reduces the chances of human error.

Both AWS and Azure offer a wide range of tools and services that can be used to automate tasks. These include things like Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, Configuration Management tools, and container Orchestration tools.

## Implement Continuous Monitoring

Continuous Monitoring is a vital part of any DevOps pipeline. It helps to identify issues early, before they have a chance to cause problems in production.

There are many tools and services that can be used for Continuous Monitoring, both from AWS and Azure. These include things like Amazon CloudWatch and Azure Monitor.

## Use DevOps Best Practices

There are a number of DevOps best practices that can be used on AWS and Azure. These include things like using Trunk-based development, using Feature Toggles, and implementing Blue/Green deployments.

## Conclusion

There are many best practices for DevOps on AWS and Azure. By following these best practices, you can help your team be successful in the cloud.
