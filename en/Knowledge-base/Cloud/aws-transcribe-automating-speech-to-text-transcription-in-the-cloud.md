# AWS Transcribe: Automating Speech-to-Text Transcription in the Cloud

Transcribing audio and video files is a time-consuming and error-prone task, which is only compounded when multiple speakers are involved. AWS Transcribe is a automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy to transcribe audio files in a variety of languages in near real-time.

AWS Transcribe can be used to transcribe customer service calls, interviews, lectures, speeches, and more. The service can be accessed through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDK.

## Getting Started with AWS Transcribe

To get started with AWS Transcribe, create an account and sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). Once you're signed in, navigate to the **Transcribe** service page and click **Create job**.

On the next page, you'll be prompted to select the input file that you want to transcribe. The file must be stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. You can also specify the language of the input file and whether to enable speaker recognition.
