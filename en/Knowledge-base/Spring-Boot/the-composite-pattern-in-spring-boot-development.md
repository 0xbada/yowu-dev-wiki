# The Composite Pattern in Spring Boot Development

The composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows developers to create hierarchies of objects. In a composite structure, individual objects, called components, are composed into larger structures, called composites.

A key feature of the composite pattern is that components can be both composites and individual objects. This flexibility allows developers to create complex structures from simpler ones.

The composite pattern is often used in software development to create user interfaces (UIs). For example, a UI might be composed of individual buttons, each of which is a component. The buttons might be arranged into a composite button bar.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at the composite pattern and how it's used in Spring Boot development. We'll also explore a few code examples to see the pattern in action.
