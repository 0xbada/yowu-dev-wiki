# Introduction

As a developer, you are likely aware of the importance of configuration in your application. Configuration files provide a way to set values that control how your application behaves. Spring Boot makes it easy to work with configuration properties by providing a set of tools to work with them.

In this article, we will take a look at what Spring Boot configuration properties are and how to work with them. We will also look at some of the gotchas that you might encounter when working with configuration properties.

# What are Spring Boot configuration properties?

Spring Boot configuration properties are key/value pairs that can be used to configure Spring Boot applications. They can be used to set values for various application settings such as the database connection string, application name, and server port. Configuration properties can be set in a number of different ways, including via environment variables, system properties, and command-line arguments.

# How to work with Spring Boot configuration properties?

Spring Boot provides a number of ways to work with configuration properties. In this section, we will take a look at some of the most common ways to work with configuration properties.

## Using @ConfigurationProperties

One way to work with configuration properties is to use the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation. This annotation can be used on a class to bind configuration properties to fields in the class. For example, the following class would bind the `spring.datasource.url` property to the `url` field:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource")
public class DataSourceConfig {
    private String url;
 
    public String getUrl() {
        return url;
    }
 
    public void setUrl(String url) {
        this.url = url;
    }
}
```

To use this class, you would need to add it as a bean in your Spring Boot application:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
 
    @Bean
    public DataSourceConfig dataSourceConfig() {
        return new DataSourceConfig();
    }
}
```

## Using the Environment abstraction

Another way to work with configuration properties is to use the `Environment` abstraction. This abstraction provides a way to access configuration properties without having to know the specific property names. For example, the following code would get the value of the `spring.datasource.url` property:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
 
    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;
 
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        String dataSourceUrl = environment.getProperty("spring.datasource.url");
    }
}
```

## Using the @Value annotation

Another way to work with configuration properties is to use the `@Value` annotation. This annotation can be used on fields to inject configuration property values. For example, the following code would inject the value of the `spring.datasource.url` property into the `url` field:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    @Value("${spring.datasource.url}")
    private String url;
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

# Spring Boot configuration property gotchas

There are a few gotchas that you might encounter when working with Spring Boot configuration properties. In this section, we will take a look at some of the most common ones.

## Properties are case-sensitive

Spring Boot configuration properties are case-sensitive. This means that the property `spring.datasource.url` is not the same as the property `spring.datasource.URL`. If you are having trouble getting a property to work, make sure that you are using the correct case.

## Properties are not resolved until the application is started

Spring Boot configuration properties are not resolved until the application is started. This means that if you try to access a property in your application's `main` method, it will not be resolved. For example, the following code will not work:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataSourceUrl = System.getProperty("spring.datasource.url");
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

To work around this, you can use the `@PostConstruct` annotation. This annotation can be used on a method to indicate that it should be called after the properties have been resolved. For example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
 
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        String dataSourceUrl = System.getProperty("spring.datasource.url");
    }
}
```

## Properties are not resolved until the application context is initialized

Another gotcha to be aware of is that properties are not resolved until the application context is initialized. This means that if you try to access a property in a `@Configuration` class, it will not be resolved. For example, the following code will not work:

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Value("${spring.datasource.url}")
    private String url;
}
```

To work around this, you can use the `Environment` abstraction. For example:

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;
 
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        String dataSourceUrl = environment.getProperty("spring.datasource.url");
    }
}
```

## Properties are not resolved until the application is fully started

Another gotcha to be aware of is that properties are not resolved until the application is fully started. This means that if you try to access a property in a `@Bean` method, it will not be resolved. For example, the following code will not work:

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        String url = System.getProperty("spring.datasource.url");
        // ...
    }
}
```

To work around this, you can use the `Environment` abstraction. For example:

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;
 
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        String url = environment.getProperty("spring.datasource.url");
        // ...
    }
}
```
