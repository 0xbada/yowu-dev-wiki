# Spring Boot Testing with JUnit

Testing is a critical part of any software development process. It helps ensure that your code is working as expected and helps catch bugs early on.

JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java. Spring Boot provides first-class support for JUnit tests. In this article, we'll take a look at how to set up and write Spring Boot tests with JUnit.

## Setting Up

To start, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

The `spring-boot-starter-test` dependency includes a number of useful libraries for writing tests, including JUnit, Hamcrest, and Mockito.

## Writing Tests

Spring Boot tests can be written in either JUnit 4 or JUnit 5. In this section, we'll take a look at an example of each.

### JUnit 4

Here's a simple example of a JUnit 4 test:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class MyTest {

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // test code goes here
    }

}
```

The `@RunWith` annotation is used to specify which testing framework to use. The `@SpringBootTest` annotation tells Spring Boot to load the application context for the test.

The `@Test` annotation is used to mark a method as a test method.

### JUnit 5

JUnit 5 tests look similar to JUnit 4 tests, but with a few key differences:

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class MyTest {

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // test code goes here
    }

}
```

First, the `@RunWith` annotation is no longer required. Second, the `@Test` annotation now belongs to the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package.

JUnit 5 also introduces a new set of assertions, which can be found in the `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` class. For example, the `assertEquals` assertion can be used like this:

```java
assertEquals(expected, actual);
```

## TestingSpringBootApplicationTests

Spring Boot provides a number of useful annotations for writing tests. In this section, we'll take a look at some of the most commonly used annotations.

### @WebMvcTest

The `@WebMvcTest` annotation is used to test Spring MVC controllers. It can be used like this:

```java
@WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
public class MyControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mvc;

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // test code goes here
    }

}
```

The `@WebMvcTest` annotation will only load the components required for testing Spring MVC. This can be useful for reducing the time it takes to load the application context for tests.

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject the `MockMvc` bean. The `MockMvc` bean can be used to send HTTP requests to the controller and verify the response.

### @DataJpaTest

The `@DataJpaTest` annotation is used to test Spring Data JPA repositories. It can be used like this:

```java
@DataJpaTest
public class MyRepositoryTest {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository repository;

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // test code goes here
    }

}
```

The `@DataJpaTest` annotation will only load the components required for testing Spring Data JPA. This can be useful for reducing the time it takes to load the application context for tests.

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject the `MyRepository` bean. This bean can be used to access the data in the database.

### @RestClientTest

The `@RestClientTest` annotation is used to test Spring RestTemplate clients. It can be used like this:

```java
@RestClientTest(MyClient.class)
public class MyClientTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockRestTemplate template;

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // test code goes here
    }

}
```

The `@RestClientTest` annotation will only load the components required for testing Spring RestTemplate. This can be useful for reducing the time it takes to load the application context for tests.

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject the `MockRestTemplate` bean. The `MockRestTemplate` bean can be used to send HTTP requests to the client and verify the response.
