## Introduction

As a Java developer, you're probably no stranger to the Spring Framework. Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

While the out-of-the-box configuration of a Spring Boot application is usually enough for most applications, there are cases where you might need to tweak the configuration. For example, if you're developing a microservice that will be deployed to a cloud environment, you might want to configure your application to use a session stateless mode, which is more appropriate for a stateless environment.

In this post, we'll take a look at some of the most common Spring Boot configuration settings and how to configure them. We'll also take a look at some of the best practices for securing a Spring Boot application.

## Configuring Spring Boot

Spring Boot applications are typically configured using a `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. The `application.properties` file is used for simple properties, while the `application.yml` file can be used for more complex configurations. We'll take a look at both files, starting with the `application.properties` file.

### application.properties

The `application.properties` file is located in the `src/main/resources` directory. This file contains a list of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the property and the value is the value of the property.

For example, let's say we want to configure our application to use a session stateless mode. We would add the following to our `application.properties` file:

```
spring.session.mode=stateless
```

Similarly, if we want to configure our application to use a specific datasource, we can add the following to our `application.properties` file:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=myusername
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
```

### application.yml

The `application.yml` file is located in the `src/main/resources` directory. This file can be used for more complex configurations, such as configuring multiple datasources or configuring aspects of the Spring Security configuration.

For example, let's say we want to configure our application to use multiple datasources. We would add the following to our `application.yml` file:

```
spring:
  datasource:
    primary:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
      username: myusername
      password: mypassword
    secondary:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/myotherdatabase
      username: myotherusername
      password: myotherpassword
```

Similarly, if we want to configure our application to use a specific version of the Hibernate JPA provider, we can add the following to our `application.yml` file:

```
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
    properties:
      hibernate:
        jpa.provider: org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider
        jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
```

## Securing Your Spring Boot Application

Now that we've looked at how to configure a Spring Boot application, let's take a look at how to secure it.

Spring Boot provides a number of features that make it easy to secure your application. For example, Spring Boot automatically configures a `SecurityProperties` bean when it detects the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency in your project. Additionally, Spring Boot provides a number of auto-configuration classes that make it easy to configure security for your application.

In this section, we'll take a look at some of the most common Spring Boot security features and how to configure them.

### Enabling HTTPS

One of the most common security concerns for web applications is ensuring that data is transmitted securely. HTTPS is the most common way to achieve this, and Spring Boot makes it easy to enable HTTPS for your application.

To enable HTTPS, you need to first configure a keystore. A keystore is a file that contains your application's SSL/TLS certificate and private key. You can generate a self-signed keystore using the Java `keytool` utility. For example, to generate a keystore with the `mykeystore.jks` file name, you can use the following command:

```
keytool -genkeypair -alias myalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore mykeystore.jks -validity 365
```

Once you have generated a keystore, you can configure Spring Boot to use it by adding the following to your `application.properties` file:

```
server.ssl.key-store: mykeystore.jks
server.ssl.key-store-password: mypassword
server.ssl.keyAlias: myalias
```

Alternatively, you can configure Spring Boot to use HTTPS by adding the following to your `application.yml` file:

```
server:
  ssl:
    key-store: mykeystore.jks
    key-store-password: mypassword
    keyAlias: myalias
```

### Using a Database Authentication Provider

One of the most common ways to authenticate users is to use a database authentication provider. Database authentication providers typically use a database table to store username and password hash values. When a user attempts to login, the authentication provider will query the database to see if there is a matching username and password hash. If there is a match, the user will be authenticated.

To configure a database authentication provider, you first need to create a database table to store the username and password hash values. You can use the following SQL to create a database table:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (username)
);
```

Once you have created the database table, you can configure Spring Boot to use it by adding the following to your `application.properties` file:

```
spring.security.user.name=myusername
spring.security.user.password=mypassword
```

Alternatively, you can configure Spring Boot to use a database authentication provider by adding the following to your `application.yml` file:

```
spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: myusername
      password: mypassword
```

### Configuring Spring Security

Spring Boot provides a number of auto-configuration classes that make it easy to configure Spring Security for your application. For example, Spring Boot automatically configures a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` when it detects the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency in your project.

The `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` provides a number of methods that can be used to configure Spring Security for your application. For example, the `configure(HttpSecurity)` method can be used to configure how web resources are secured.

Additionally, Spring Boot provides a number of HASmatchers that can be used to restrict access to web resources. For example, the `hasIpAddress()` matcher can be used to restrict access to a web resource to only clients with a specific IP address.
