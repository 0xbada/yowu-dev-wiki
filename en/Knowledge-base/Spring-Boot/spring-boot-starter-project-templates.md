# Spring Boot Starter Project Templates

Developing a Spring Boot application can be a daunting task. There are many moving parts and it can be difficult to know where to start. This is where Spring Boot starter project templates come in.

A starter project template is a pre-configured Spring Boot application that you can use as a starting point for your own application. These templates can be a great way to get up and running quickly with a minimum of fuss.

In this article, we will take a look at some of the most popular starter project templates and see how they can help you get your Spring Boot application off the ground.

## Spring Boot Web Starter

The Spring Boot Web Starter is the most popular starter project template. It provides everything you need to get a basic Spring Boot web application up and running.

The Web Starter includes the following dependencies:

- spring-boot-starter-web
- spring-boot-starter-tomcat
- spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf

It also includes the following key features:

- Embedded Tomcat
- Support for Thymeleaf templates
- Automatic configuration for Spring MVC

Getting started with the Web Starter is simple. You can create a new project using the Spring Initializr and selecting the Web Starter from the list of starters.

Once you have your project set up, you can add a controller to handle requests to your application. For example, the following controller would map requests to the `/` path to a Thymeleaf template named `index.html`:

```java
@Controller
public class IndexController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String index() {
        return "index";
    }

}
```

You can then add your `index.html` template to the `src/main/resources/templates` directory. The Web Starter will automatically configure Thymeleaf and you will be able to access your template at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Spring Boot Data JPA Starter

The Spring Boot Data JPA Starter is another popular starter project template. It provides everything you need to get started with Spring Data JPA.

The Data JPA Starter includes the following dependencies:

- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
- spring-boot-starter-aop
- spring-boot-starter-jdbc

It also includes the following key features:

- Automatic configuration for Spring Data JPA
- Support for transactions
- Support for auditing

Getting started with the Data JPA Starter is just as simple as the Web Starter. You can create a new project using the Spring Initializr and selecting the Data JPA Starter from the list of starters.

Once you have your project set up, you can add a JPA entity to represent your data. For example, the following entity represents a user:

```java
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private String email;

    // Getters and setters...

}
```

You can then add a repository interface to access your data. The following repository would provide methods for finding users by their id or email:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {

    User findById(Long id);

    User findByEmail(String email);

}
```

Spring Data JPA will automatically implement this interface for you. You can then inject the repository into your controllers and use it to access your data.

## Spring Boot Security Starter

The Spring Boot Security Starter is a great starting point for applications that need to provide authentication and authorization.

The Security Starter includes the following dependencies:

- spring-boot-starter-security
- spring-security-config

It also includes the following key features:

- Automatic configuration for Spring Security
- Support for form-based authentication
- Security for static resources

Getting started with the Security Starter is just as simple as the other starters. You can create a new project using the Spring Initializr and selecting the Security Starter from the list of starters.

Once you have your project set up, you can add a security configuration to your application. For example, the following configuration would secure all URLs with the `/admin` path:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().permitAll()
            .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .permitAll();
    }

}
```

This configuration would secure all URLs with the `/admin` path and require the user to be authenticated with the `ADMIN` role. It would also provide a login page at `/login` that would allow users to authenticate.

## Spring Boot Actuator Starter

The Spring Boot Actuator Starter is a great starting point for applications that need to provide monitoring and management capabilities.

The Actuator Starter includes the following dependencies:

- spring-boot-starter-actuator

It also includes the following key features:

- Automatic configuration for Spring Boot Actuator
- Endpoints for application monitoring and management

Getting started with the Actuator Starter is just as simple as the other starters. You can create a new project using the Spring Initializr and selecting the Actuator Starter from the list of starters.

Once you have your project set up, you can add actuator endpoints to your application. For example, the following configuration would enable the `info` and `health` endpoints:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class ActuatorConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/actuator/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .httpBasic();
    }

}
```

This configuration would enable the `info` and `health` endpoints. These endpoints provide information about the application and its health.
