# 066: Creating a Batch Processing System in Spring Boot

In this post, we'll learn how to create a batch processing system in Spring Boot. We'll cover the following topics:

* What is batch processing?
* Why use Spring Boot for batch processing?
* Setting up a Spring Boot project for batch processing
* Creating a batch job
* Running a batch job

## What is batch processing?

Batch processing is the execution of a series of jobs in a predetermined, sequential order. A batch job is a unit of work that is typically executed as a single process. Batch jobs are typically used for long-running, resource-intensive tasks that are not suitable for real-time execution, such as data ETL (extract, transform, and load), data cleansing, or data aggregation.

## Why use Spring Boot for batch processing?

Spring Boot is a popular framework for building Java applications. It is designed to simplify the development and deployment of Spring-based applications. Spring Boot is a great choice for building batch processing systems because it provides a simple and straightforward way to configure and execute batch jobs.

## Setting up a Spring Boot project for batch processing

To set up a Spring Boot project for batch processing, we need to add the following dependencies to our project:

* spring-boot-starter-batch - This is the starter module for Spring Boot batch jobs.
* mysql-connector-java - This is the MySQL JDBC driver. We'll use MySQL as our database.

## Creating a batch job

We'll create a simple batch job that reads data from a CSV file and writes it to a MySQL database. The job will have the following steps:

1. Read data from a CSV file
2. Transform the data
3. Write the data to a MySQL database

## Running a batch job

To run our batch job, we'll use the Spring Boot Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is a tool that allows us to run Spring Boot applications from the command line.
