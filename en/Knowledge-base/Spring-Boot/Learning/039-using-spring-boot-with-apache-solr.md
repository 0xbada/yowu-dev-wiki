# Using Spring Boot with Apache Solr

In this post, we'll take a look at how to use Spring Boot with Apache Solr. We'll cover the following topics:

- What is Apache Solr?
- Why use Apache Solr with Spring Boot?
- How to use Apache Solr with Spring Boot?
- What are some common use cases for Apache Solr?

## What is Apache Solr?

Apache Solr is a powerful open source search platform built on top of Apache Lucene. It provides a robust and scalable search solution for websites and applications.

## Why use Apache Solr with Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a popular Java framework for building web applications. It makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can "just run."

 Apache Solr is a great fit for Spring Boot applications because it is easy to set up and configure. Spring Boot also provides first-class support for Solr via the Spring Data Solr project.

## How to use Apache Solr with Spring Boot?

Using Apache Solr with Spring Boot is easy. In this section, we'll walk through the steps necessary to set up and use Apache Solr with a Spring Boot application.

### 1. Add the Spring Boot Starter Dependency

First, we need to add the Spring Boot Starter dependency for Solr to our `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-solr</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Configure the Solr Server URL

Next, we need to configure the Solr server URL. This can be done in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.data.solr.host=http://localhost:8983/solr
```

### 3. Create a Solr Repository

Spring Data Solr provides a `SolrRepository` interface that we can use to create a Solr repository. For example:

```java
public interface ProductRepository extends SolrRepository<Product, String> {

}
```

### 4. Use the Solr Repository

We can now inject and use our `ProductRepository` in our code:

```java
@Autowired
private ProductRepository productRepository;

public List<Product> findByName(String name) {
    return productRepository.findByName(name);
}
```

## What are some common use cases for Apache Solr?

Apache Solr is a versatile search platform that can be used for a variety of different use cases. Some common use cases include:

- E-commerce product search
- Site search
- Enterprise search
- Log analysis
