# Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used for creating microservices. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production-ready spring applications.

Microservices are a type of software architecture where large applications are built as a set of small services. Each service is responsible for a specific business function. This makes it easier to develop, deploy, and scale applications.

Spring Boot is based on the Spring framework. It uses various modules of the Spring framework to provide a complete set of features for microservices. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications.

## What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?

There are many benefits of using Spring Boot:

- It is easy to create stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications.
- It reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to create a new microservice.
- It uses various modules of the Spring framework to provide a complete set of features for microservices.
- It makes it easy to deploy and scale applications.

## What are the features of Spring Boot?

Some of the key features of Spring Boot are:

- Auto-configuration: Spring Boot auto-configures beans and properties based on the dependencies present in the classpath.

- Embedded servers: Spring Boot comes with embedded servers which makes it easy to deploy and run applications.

- Starter dependencies: Spring Boot comes with a set of starter dependencies which makes it easy to add dependencies to the project.

- Actuator: Spring Boot comes with actuator which provides a set of tools to monitor and manage applications.
