# Implementing a Custom Authentication Provider in Spring Boot

When it comes to authentication in Spring Boot, there are a few different ways to go about it. In this post, we'll take a look at how to implement a custom authentication provider.

## What is an Authentication Provider?

An authentication provider is a piece of software that handles the process of authenticating a user. In the context of a web application, this typically means verifying that the user has provided the correct credentials (username and password) and, if so, allowing them access to the application.

## Why Use a Custom Authentication Provider?

There are a few reasons you might want to use a custom authentication provider:

* You want to use a different method of authentication than what is provided out-of-the-box by Spring Boot (e.g. you want to use LDAP instead of a database).
* You want to add extra functionality to the authentication process (e.g. you want to log all failed login attempts).
* You want more control over how the authentication process works (e.g. you want to be able to customize the error messages that are displayed to the user).

## How to Implement a Custom Authentication Provider

Implementing a custom authentication provider is actually quite simple. All you need to do is create a class that implements the org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationProvider interface.

Here's a simple example:

```java
public class MyAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider {

    @Override
    public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
        // TODO: Implement authentication logic here
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> authentication) {
        // TODO: Implement authentication support logic here
        return false;
    }
}
```

There are two methods that need to be implemented:

* `authenticate()`: This is where the actual authentication logic goes. The method takes an `Authentication` object as a parameter and returns an `Authentication` object.
* `supports()`: This method is used to determine if the `AuthenticationProvider` supports the given `Authentication` object.

## Configuring the Authentication Provider

Once the `AuthenticationProvider` has been implemented, the next step is to configure it in Spring Boot. This can be done by adding the following to the `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.security.authentication-provider.class=com.example.MyAuthenticationProvider
```

## Testing the Authentication Provider

To test the authentication provider, you can use the `@WithMockUser` annotation on a test method. This will create a mock user with the given username and password that can be used to authenticate against the authentication provider.

Here's a simple example:

```java
@Test
@WithMockUser(username="test", password="test")
public void testAuthentication() {
    // TODO: Implement authentication test here
}
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we've looked at how to implement a custom authentication provider in Spring Boot. We've also seen how to configure it and how to test it.
