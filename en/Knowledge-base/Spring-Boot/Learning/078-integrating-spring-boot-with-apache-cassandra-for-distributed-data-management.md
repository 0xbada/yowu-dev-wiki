# 078: Integrating Spring Boot with Apache Cassandra for Distributed Data Management

## Introduction

In this post, we'll look at how to integrate [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) with [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) for distributed data management.

Cassandra is a highly scalable, NoSQL database that is well-suited for large scale data storage and management. Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

## Cassandra Overview

Cassandra is a NoSQL database that is designed for high availability and scalability. It is a popular choice for large scale data storage and management.

Cassandra is a [masterless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterless_architecture) database, which means that there is no single point of failure. Data is replicated across multiple nodes in the Cassandra cluster, and each node can act as a [seed node](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/initialize/initializeSingleDS.html) for other nodes.

Cassandra is also [linearly scalable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_scalability), which means that it can handle increasing load by adding more nodes to the cluster.

## Cassandra Data Model

Cassandra uses a [column-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS) data model. Data is organized into [column families](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlAboutDataModels.html), which are similar to tables in a relational database.

Each column family has a [primary key](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlPrimaryKeyConcept.html), which is used to uniquely identify a row of data. A primary key is made up of one or more [columns](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlColumns.html).

Cassandra also supports [secondary indexes](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlIndexesConcept.html), which can be used to query data in a column family by a column that is not part of the primary key.

## Cassandra Query Language

Cassandra uses a [SQL-like query language](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.x/cassandra/dml/dmlSelect.html) called CQL (Cassandra Query Language) that is used to query and update data in a Cassandra database.

CQL is similar to SQL, but it is not a fully compliant SQL database. There are some [differences](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/cqlCommandsTOC.html) between CQL and SQL that you should be aware of when working with Cassandra.

## Spring Boot Overview

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a popular Java framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

Spring Boot is based on the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework), which is a popular Java application framework. Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-based applications by providing a [default configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) and [starter dependencies](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-maven-guides.html#getting-started-with-maven-dependency-management) that can be used to create a variety of applications.

## Spring Boot and Cassandra

Spring Boot makes it easy to [integrate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-nosql.html#boot-features-nosql-cassandra) with Cassandra. Spring Boot provides a [Cassandra auto-configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-nosql.html#boot-features-nosql-cassandra) that can be used to configure and connect to a Cassandra database.

Spring Boot also provides a [CassandraTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/cassandra/core/CassandraTemplate.html) object that can be used to query and update data in a Cassandra database.

## Getting Started

In this section, we'll look at how to get started with Spring Boot and Cassandra. We'll start by creating a new Spring Boot project using the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).

We'll need to add the following dependencies to our project:

- Web - Used to add a web server to our application
- Cassandra - Used to connect to a Cassandra database

We'll also need to add the following Maven dependencies to our project:

- [Cassandra Driver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.cassandra/cassandra-driver-core) - Used to connect to a Cassandra database
- [Cassandra Unit](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.cassandraunit/cassandra-unit) - Used to unit test our Cassandra code

## Configuring Cassandra

In this section, we'll look at how to configure Cassandra for our Spring Boot application.

We'll start by adding a [Cassandra configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/current/reference/html/#cassandra-configuration) file to our project. This file will be used to configure our Cassandra connection.

We'll need to set the following properties in our configuration file:

- `cassandra.contact-points` - The Cassandra contact points that our application will use to connect to the Cassandra cluster
- `cassandra.port` - The port that our Cassandra cluster is running on
- `cassandra.keyspace-name` - The name of the keyspace that our application will use
- `cassandra.username` - The username that our application will use to connect to Cassandra
- `cassandra.password` - The password that our application will use to connect to Cassandra

## Creating a Cassandra Entity

In this section, we'll look at how to create a [Cassandra entity](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/current/reference/html/#cassandra-mapping-entity) class.

Cassandra entities are similar to [JPA entities](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#orm-support.jpa.entity). They are used to map a Cassandra table to a Java class.

We'll need to annotate our Cassandra entity class with the `@Table` annotation. This annotation is used to specify the name of the Cassandra table that our entity will be mapped to.

We'll also need to annotate our entity class with the `@PrimaryKeyClass` annotation. This annotation is used to specify the primary key class for our entity.

Our primary key class will need to annotate the `@PrimaryKeyColumn` annotation for each primary key column. This annotation is used to specify the name of the column and the order in which it will be used in the primary key.

## Creating a Cassandra Repository

In this section, we'll look at how to create a [Cassandra repository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.details) interface.

Cassandra repositories are similar to [JPA repositories](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories). They are used to access data in a Cassandra database.

We'll need to annotate our Cassandra repository interface with the `@Repository` annotation. This annotation is used to mark our interface as a Spring Data repository.

We'll also need to annotate our repository interface with the `@CassandraRepository` annotation. This annotation is used to mark our interface as a Cassandra repository.

We can use the `@Query` annotation on our repository methods to specify a CQL query. We can also use the `@Param` annotation to bind method parameters to CQL query parameters.

## Unit Testing Cassandra Code

In this section, we'll look at how to unit test our Cassandra code.

We'll start by annotating our test class with the `@RunWith(CassandraUnitRunner.class)` annotation. This annotation is used to run our unit tests with the Cassandra Unit runner.

We'll also need to annotate our test class with the `@CassandraDataSet` annotation. This annotation is used to load a Cassandra data set into our test environment.

We can use the `@EmbeddedCassandra` annotation to start an embedded Cassandra server for our unit tests. We can also use the `@SharedEmbeddedCassandra` annotation to start a shared embedded Cassandra server for our unit tests.

## Conclusion
