# Using the Spring Boot CLI for Scaffolding a Project

The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that can be used to quickly scaffold a Spring Boot project. In this post, we'll take a look at how to use the Spring Boot CLI to scaffold a project.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install the Spring Boot CLI. You can find instructions for doing so [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli).

Once you have the Spring Boot CLI installed, you can use it to scaffold a project by running the following command:

```
$ spring init -d=web,jpa,security my-project
```

This will create a new Spring Boot project with the `web`, `jpa`, and `security` dependencies.
