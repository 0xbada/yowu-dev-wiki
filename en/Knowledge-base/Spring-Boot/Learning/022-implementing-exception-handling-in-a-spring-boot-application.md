# Implementing Exception Handling in a Spring Boot Application

Exception handling is a critical part of any application. In a Spring Boot application, there are a few ways to implement exception handling.

In this post, we'll go over some of the basics of exception handling in a Spring Boot application. We'll start with a simple example, then we'll go over some more advanced topics.

## Basic Exception Handling

The simplest way to handle exceptions in a Spring Boot application is to use the @ControllerAdvice annotation. This annotation can be used on a class to handle exceptions globally.

For example, let's say we have a simple controller that returns a list of users:

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
 
    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<User> getUsers() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

If there is an error while getting the list of users, we can use the @ControllerAdvice annotation to handle the exception:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionHandlerController {
 
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(Exception ex) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above example, we're using the @ExceptionHandler annotation to handle any exceptions that occur in our controller. We're also using the @ControllerAdvice annotation to make sure that our exception handler is applied globally.

## Advanced Exception Handling

In some cases, you may want to have more control over how exceptions are handled. For example, you may want to return a different response for different types of exceptions.

In Spring Boot, you can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation to handle specific types of exceptions. For example, let's say we have a controller that returns a list of users:

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
 
    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<User> getUsers() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

If there is an error while getting the list of users, we can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation to handle the exception:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionHandlerController {
 
    @ExceptionHandler(UserNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleUserNotFoundException(UserNotFoundException ex) {
        // ...
    }
 
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(Exception ex) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above example, we're using the @ExceptionHandler annotation to handle specific types of exceptions. We're also using the @ControllerAdvice annotation to make sure that our exception handler is applied globally.
