# Implementing a file download in a Spring Boot application

In this post, we'll go over how to implement a file download in a Spring Boot application.

We'll start by looking at the requirements for our file downloader. We'll then implement a simple file downloader using the Spring Boot framework. Finally, we'll test our file downloader to make sure it works as expected.

## Requirements

Our file downloader will need to meet the following requirements:

- It should be able to download files from a URL.
- It should be able to download files of any type.
- It should be able to download large files.
- It should be able to download files using HTTP or HTTPS.
- It should be able to download files from behind a firewall.

## Implementation

We'll start by creating a new Spring Boot project. We'll then add the following dependencies to our project:

- spring-boot-starter-web
- spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf

Our file downloader will be a simple web application. We'll use Thymeleaf to render our HTML templates.

Next, we'll create a new controller class. This controller will contain the methods that our file downloader will use to download files.

We'll start by implementing a method that downloads a file from a URL. This method will take a URL as a parameter and return a File object.

```java
@RequestMapping("/download")
public File downloadFile(String url) {
    // TODO: implement file download
}
```

We'll use the Java URL class to download the file from the given URL. We'll then return a File object that contains the downloaded file.

Next, we'll implement a method that downloads a file of a given type. This method will take a file type as a parameter and return a File object.

```java
@RequestMapping("/download")
public File downloadFile(String type) {
    // TODO: implement file download
}
```

We'll use the Java URLConnection class to download the file of the given type. We'll then return a File object that contains the downloaded file.

Finally, we'll implement a method that downloads a large file. This method will take a URL and a file size as parameters and return a File object.

```java
@RequestMapping("/download")
public File downloadFile(String url, long size) {
    // TODO: implement file download
}
```

We'll use the Java HttpURLConnection class to download the large file from the given URL. We'll then return a File object that contains the downloaded file.

## Testing

We'll now write some unit tests to test our file downloader.

First, we'll write a test that downloads a small file. This test will take a URL and a file size as parameters and return a File object.

```java
@Test
public void testDownloadFile() {
    String url = "http://example.com/file.txt";
    long size = 100;
    File file = downloader.downloadFile(url, size);
    assertThat(file).isNotNull();
    assertThat(file.length()).isEqualTo(size);
}
```

Next, we'll write a test that downloads a large file. This test will take a URL and a file size as parameters and return a File object.

```java
@Test
public void testDownloadLargeFile() {
    String url = "http://example.com/file.txt";
    long size = 100000;
    File file = downloader.downloadFile(url, size);
    assertThat(file).isNotNull();
    assertThat(file.length()).isEqualTo(size);
}
```

Finally, we'll write a test that downloads a file of a given type. This test will take a file type as a parameter and return a File object.

```java
@Test
public void testDownloadFileOfType() {
    String type = "pdf";
    File file = downloader.downloadFile(type);
    assertThat(file).isNotNull();
    assertThat(file.getName()).endsWith(".pdf");
}
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we've gone over how to implement a file download in a Spring Boot application. We've also seen how to write some unit tests to test our file downloader.
