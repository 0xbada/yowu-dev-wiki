# 061: Integrating Spring Boot with NoSQL Databases

In this post, we'll learn how to integrate a Spring Boot application with a NoSQL database.

## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL is a term used to describe a non-relational database. A NoSQL database is one that does not use the traditional table-based relational model used by most relational databases.

NoSQL databases are often more scalable and easier to work with than relational databases. They are also well suited for storing large amounts of data that is not easily structured into a traditional table-based schema.

## Why use NoSQL with Spring Boot?

NoSQL databases are a good choice for many Spring Boot applications. They are often more scalable and easier to work with than relational databases. Spring Boot provides good support for NoSQL databases, making it easy to work with them in your application.

## How to integrate NoSQL with Spring Boot

 Spring Boot provides good support for NoSQL databases. You can use any of the popular NoSQL databases with Spring Boot. In this post, we will use MongoDB as our NoSQL database.

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is easy to use with Spring Boot. Spring Boot provides a starter module for MongoDB that makes it easy to work with MongoDB in your application.

To use MongoDB with Spring Boot, you will need to add the spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb starter module to your project. You can add this module to your project using the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You will also need to configure MongoDB with your application. You can do this by adding a MongoDB configuration file to your application. The following is a basic MongoDB configuration file:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost/test
```

This configuration file tells Spring Boot to connect to a MongoDB database at localhost on the default port (27017). The database name is test.

## Summary

In this post, we learned how to integrate a Spring Boot application with a NoSQL database. We also learned why you might want to use a NoSQL database with Spring Boot and how to configure MongoDB with Spring Boot.
