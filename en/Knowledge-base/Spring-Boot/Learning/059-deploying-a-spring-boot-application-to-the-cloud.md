# 059: Deploying a Spring Boot Application to the Cloud 

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services). It can be deployed in different ways, such as public, private, or hybrid. 

In this post, we will focus on how to deploy a Spring Boot application to the cloud. We will use the example of [Spring Cloud GCP](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp) to show how to quickly and easily deploy a Spring Boot application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Prerequisites

- A GCP account
- A Spring Boot application

## Step 1: Create a GCP Project

First, we need to create a GCP project. This can be done through the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

## Step 2: Enable the Cloud Build and App Engine APIs

Next, we need to enable the Cloud Build and App Engine APIs. This can be done through the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).

## Step 3: Create a Cloud Build Trigger

Now, we need to create a Cloud Build trigger. This can be done through the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers).

## Step 4: Deploy the Application

Finally, we can deploy the application. This can be done through the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/deploy).

## Conclusion

In this post, we have seen how to deploy a Spring Boot application to the cloud using GCP.
