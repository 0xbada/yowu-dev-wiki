# 068: Debugging a Spring Boot Application with the Spring Boot Debugger

Developers face many challenges when trying to debug a Spring Boot application. The Spring Boot Debugger is a powerful tool that can help developers to overcome these challenges and get to the root cause of their problem quickly.

In this post, we will take a look at how to use the Spring Boot Debugger to debug a Spring Boot application. We will also learn about some of the features of the debugger that can be used to troubleshoot common Spring Boot issues.

## Setting up the Spring Boot Debugger

The first step in using the Spring Boot Debugger is to ensure that it is properly configured. In most cases, the debugger will be configured automatically when the application is started in debug mode. However, there are some cases where the debugger may need to be manually configured.

The easiest way to configure the debugger is to use the Spring Boot Debugger plugin for your IDE. This plugin will automatically add the necessary configuration to your application.

Alternatively, you can add the following configuration to your application.properties file:

```
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
```

## Using the Spring Boot Debugger

Once the debugger is properly configured, you can start using it to debug your application. The debugger can be used to debug both web applications and non-web applications.

To debug a web application, you can use the following steps:

1. Start your application in debug mode.
2. Connect to the application using a debugger client.
3. Set breakpoints in your code.
4. Inspect variables and analyze the call stack.

To debug a non-web application, you can use the following steps:

1. Start your application in debug mode.
2. Connect to the application using a debugger client.
3. Set breakpoints in your code.
4. Inspect variables and analyze the call stack.
5. Attach to the running application.

## Features of the Spring Boot Debugger

The Spring Boot Debugger has many features that can be used to troubleshoot common Spring Boot issues.

### Hot Swap

Hot Swap is a feature of the debugger that allows developers to make changes to their code and have those changes take effect immediately. This is especially useful for fixing bugs in a live application.

To use Hot Swap, simply make the desired changes to your code and save the file. The changes will take effect immediately.

### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are another useful feature of the debugger. Breakpoints can be used to pause the execution of your code at a specific line. This allows you to inspect variables and the call stack to see what is happening in your code.

Breakpoints can be added in your code by clicking on the line number in your IDE. Alternatively, you can use the following command to add a breakpoint:

```
debug: breakpoint MyClass.java:12
```

### Inspecting Variables

When your code is paused at a breakpoint, you can inspect the values of variables. This can be done in your IDE or by using the following command:

```
debug: inspect myVariable
```

### Analyzing the Call Stack

The call stack can be used to see the sequence of method calls that led to the current state of your code. This can be useful for understanding why your code is not behaving as expected.

The call stack can be viewed in your IDE or by using the following command:

```
debug: trace
```
