# 036: Integrating with a payment gateway using Spring Boot

Integrating with a payment gateway is a common requirement for many web applications. In this post, we'll take a look at how to do this using Spring Boot.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few things you'll need:

- A Spring Boot application
- A payment gateway account

## Configuring the payment gateway

The first thing you'll need to do is configure your payment gateway account. This will involve setting up an API key or username and password, depending on the gateway you're using. Consult the documentation for your chosen gateway for more information.

## Adding the dependency

Once you have your payment gateway account configured, you'll need to add the dependency for the gateway to your Spring Boot application. The dependency will be different for each gateway, so consult the documentation for your chosen gateway.

## Configuring the application

Once the dependency has been added, you'll need to configure your application to use the gateway. The configuration will be different for each gateway, so consult the documentation for your chosen gateway.

## Adding the code

Now that your application is configured, you'll need to add the code to integrate with the payment gateway. The code will be different for each gateway, so consult the documentation for your chosen gateway.

## Testing the integration

Once you've added the code to integrate with the payment gateway, you'll need to test the integration to make sure everything is working as expected. The tests will be different for each gateway, so consult the documentation for your chosen gateway.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've looked at how to integrate with a payment gateway using Spring Boot. We've configured the gateway, added the dependency, configured the application, added the code, and tested the integration.
