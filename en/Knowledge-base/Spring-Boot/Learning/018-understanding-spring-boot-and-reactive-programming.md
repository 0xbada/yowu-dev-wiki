# Understanding Spring Boot and Reactive Programming

In this post, we'll take a look at Spring Boot and reactive programming, and how they can be used together.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a framework for building web applications using the Spring framework. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that can be deployed quickly and easily.

## What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that is designed to deal with asynchronous data streams. In reactive programming, data is processed as it comes in, in a non-blocking fashion.

Reactive programming is a great fit for event-driven applications, such as web applications.

## Spring Boot and Reactive Programming

Spring Boot and reactive programming can be used together to build web applications in a more efficient and effective way.

When using Spring Boot and reactive programming together, web applications can be built using a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This can lead to more responsive and scalable applications.

In addition, Spring Boot provides many features that can make developing reactive applications easier, such as auto-configuration and starter dependencies.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in learning more about Spring Boot and reactive programming, there are a few resources that can help you get started.

First, check out the Spring Boot website [https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). There, you'll find documentation, guides, and other resources that can help you learn about Spring Boot.

Next, take a look at the Spring Boot reference documentation [https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/). This resource can be helpful in understanding how to use Spring Boot to build web applications.

Finally, the Spring Boot Starters guide [https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) can be a helpful resource in understanding how to use Spring Boot starter dependencies to add features to your application.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've taken a look at Spring Boot and reactive programming. We've seen how these two technologies can be used together to build web applications in a more efficient and effective way.
