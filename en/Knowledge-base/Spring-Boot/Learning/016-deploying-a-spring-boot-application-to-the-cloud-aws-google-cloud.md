# 016: Deploying a Spring Boot application to the cloud (AWS, Google Cloud)

Developers are always looking for ways to improve their workflow and speed up the process of getting their code from development to production. In this post, we will explore how to use cloud services to deploy a Spring Boot application.

## AWS

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform that provides a variety of services that can be used to deploy applications. AWS offers a free tier that can be used to deploy small applications.

To deploy a Spring Boot application to AWS, we will first need to create an AWS account. Once the account has been created, we can then create a new AWS Elastic Beanstalk application.

We will need to select the region that we want to deploy our application to. AWS offers a variety of regions, each with its own unique set of resources.

Once the application has been created, we can then upload our Spring Boot application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. AWS Elastic Beanstalk will then take care of deploying our application.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud is a cloud platform that offers a variety of services that can be used to deploy applications. Google Cloud offers a free tier that can be used to deploy small applications.

To deploy a Spring Boot application to Google Cloud, we will first need to create a Google Cloud account. Once the account has been created, we can then create a new Google App Engine application.

We will need to select the region that we want to deploy our application to. Google Cloud offers a variety of regions, each with its own unique set of resources.

Once the application has been created, we can then upload our Spring Boot application to Google App Engine. Google App Engine will then take care of deploying our application.
