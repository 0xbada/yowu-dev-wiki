# Implementing a Custom Error Handling System in Spring Boot

It is important to have a well-defined and comprehensive error handling system in place for any web application. This is especially true for applications built using the Spring Boot framework.

In this post, we will take a look at how to implement a custom error handling system in Spring Boot. We will cover the following topics:

1. What is Spring Boot?
2. What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?
3. What are the features of the Spring Boot framework?
4. How to implement a custom error handling system in Spring Boot?

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used for creating microservices and web applications. It is developed by Pivotal Software and is a member of the Spring family of frameworks.

Spring Boot is designed to simplify the process of creating and deploying Spring-based applications. It provides a number of features, such as auto-configuration and starter templates, which make it easier to get started with Spring.

## What are the benefits of using Spring Boot?

There are a number of benefits to using Spring Boot, including the following:

- Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- Spring Boot provides a number of features, such as auto-configuration and starter templates, which make it easier to get started with Spring.
- Spring Boot is opinionated, which means that it provides a set of defaults that are suitable for most applications. This makes it easier to get started with Spring Boot, as you don't have to worry about configuring everything yourself.

## What are the features of the Spring Boot framework?

Spring Boot provides a number of features that make it an attractive choice for building microservices and web applications. These features include:

- Auto-configuration: Spring Boot auto-configures beans and properties based on the dependencies it finds on the classpath. This makes it easier to get started with Spring Boot, as you don't have to worry about configuring everything yourself.
- Starter templates: Spring Boot provides a number of starter templates that can be used to create a new project. These starter templates include everything you need to get started, such as the dependencies and build scripts.
- Command line interface: Spring Boot includes a command line interface that can be used to run commands, such as starting and stopping the application.
- Actuator: Spring Boot includes an actuator that can be used to monitor and manage the application.

## How to implement a custom error handling system in Spring Boot?

There are a number of ways to implement a custom error handling system in Spring Boot. In this section, we will take a look at two of the most common approaches:

- Using a @ControllerAdvice annotation
- Creating a custom error controller

### Using a @ControllerAdvice annotation

One way to implement a custom error handling system in Spring Boot is to use the @ControllerAdvice annotation. This annotation can be used to define a global error handler for all controllers in the application.

The following is an example of how to use the @ControllerAdvice annotation:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
 
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(Exception ex) {
 
        ErrorResponse error = new ErrorResponse();
        error.setMessage(ex.getMessage());
        error.setStatusCode(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value());
 
        return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we have defined a global error handler that will be invoked for all exceptions. This handler will create an instance of the ErrorResponse class and return it to the client.

### Creating a custom error controller

Another way to implement a custom error handling system in Spring Boot is to create a custom error controller. This controller can be used to handle errors for specific controllers in the application.

The following is an example of how to create a custom error controller:

```java
@RestController
public class ErrorController extends AbstractErrorController {
 
    @Override
    public String getErrorPath() {
        return "/error";
    }
 
    @RequestMapping("/error")
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> error(HttpServletRequest request) {
 
        ErrorResponse error = new ErrorResponse();
        error.setMessage(request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.error.message").toString());
        error.setStatusCode(Integer.valueOf(request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.error.status_code").toString()));
 
        return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we have defined a custom error controller that will be invoked for all requests that result in an error. This controller will create an instance of the ErrorResponse class and return it to the client.
