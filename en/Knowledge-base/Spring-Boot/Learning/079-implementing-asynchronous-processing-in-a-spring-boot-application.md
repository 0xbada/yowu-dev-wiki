# 079: Implementing Asynchronous Processing in a Spring Boot Application

Asynchronous processing is a way of processing tasks in a parallel or non-blocking way. In a Spring Boot application, asynchronous processing can be used to improve the performance of long-running tasks by offloading them to a separate thread.

In this post, we'll take a look at how to implement asynchronous processing in a Spring Boot application. We'll start by looking at the different types of asynchronous processing that can be used in Spring Boot. We'll then look at how to configure Spring Boot to use asynchronous processing. Finally, we'll look at some tips for using asynchronous processing in a Spring Boot application.

## Types of Asynchronous Processing

There are two types of asynchronous processing that can be used in Spring Boot:

* Parallel processing: This is a type of asynchronous processing where tasks are executed in parallel. Parallel processing can be used to improve the performance of long-running tasks by distributing the work across multiple threads.

* Non-blocking processing: This is a type of asynchronous processing where tasks are executed in a non-blocking way. Non-blocking processing can be used to improve the responsiveness of an application by avoiding the need to wait for long-running tasks to complete.

## Configuring Asynchronous Processing

To use asynchronous processing in a Spring Boot application, you need to configure the application to use a task executor. A task executor is a component that is responsible for executing tasks in a parallel or non-blocking way.

Spring Boot provides a number of different task executors that can be used for different types of asynchronous processing. For example, the SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor can be used for parallel processing, and the CallableProcessingInterceptor can be used for non-blocking processing.

To configure the application to use a task executor, you need to add the following property to the application.properties file:

spring.task.executor.pool.size=10

This property configures the size of the task executor pool. The task executor pool is used to execute tasks in a parallel or non-blocking way.

## Tips for Using Asynchronous Processing

When using asynchronous processing in a Spring Boot application, there are a few things to keep in mind:

* Avoid using synchronous methods: When using asynchronous processing, avoid using synchronous methods. Synchronous methods can block the thread that is executing the task, which can cause the task to take longer to complete.

* Use a task executor: When using asynchronous processing, make sure to use a task executor. A task executor can help to improve the performance of long-running tasks by distributing the work across multiple threads.

* Use a callback: When using asynchronous processing, make sure to use a callback. A callback can help to improve the responsiveness of an application by avoiding the need to wait for long-running tasks to complete.
