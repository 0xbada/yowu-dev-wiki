# 012: Using Spring Boot with message brokers (RabbitMQ)

In this post, we'll look at how to use Spring Boot with message brokers, specifically RabbitMQ. We'll cover what message brokers are, how to use them with Spring Boot, and some best practices.

## What is a message broker?

A message broker is a piece of software that helps manage communication between different applications. It does this by acting as a middleman between the applications. The applications can send messages to the broker, which then forwards the messages to the appropriate applications.

## Why use a message broker?

There are a few reasons you might want to use a message broker.

### 1. decoupling applications

One of the main reasons to use a message broker is to decouple applications. By decoupling, we mean that the applications are not directly dependent on each other. This has a few benefits.

First, it means that the applications can be developed independently. This can be a big advantage if you have a large team working on different parts of the system.

Second, it makes the applications more resilient. If one application goes down, the others can still continue to work.

### 2. scalability

Another reason to use a message broker is for scalability. If you have a lot of traffic, you can add more brokers to handle the load. This is much easier than trying to scale a single application.

## How to use a message broker with Spring Boot

Now that we've seen some of the reasons to use a message broker, let's look at how to use one with Spring Boot.

Spring Boot has good support for message brokers. We can use the `spring-boot-starter-amqp` dependency to add support for RabbitMQ.

To use RabbitMQ, we need to add the following to our `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest
```

Replace `localhost` with the hostname of your RabbitMQ server. The default port is `5672`. The username and password are the defaults for RabbitMQ.

Once we've added the properties, we can inject a `RabbitTemplate` into our code. This is the class we'll use to send and receive messages.

Here's a simple example of how to use the template to send a message:

```java
@Autowired
private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("exchange", "routingKey", message);
}
```

The `convertAndSend` method takes an exchange, a routing key, and a message. The exchange is the name of the exchange to use. The routing key is used to route the message to the correct queue. The message can be any object that can be converted to a byte array.

We can also receive messages using the `receiveAndConvert` method:

```java
@Autowired
private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

public String receiveMessage() {
    return (String)rabbitTemplate.receiveAndConvert("queue");
}
```

This method takes a queue name and returns an object. We need to cast the object to the correct type.

## Best practices

Now that we've seen how to use a message broker with Spring Boot, let's look at some best practices.

### 1. use message converters

Spring Boot comes with a number of message converters. These converters can be used to convert between different message formats. For example, we can use the `StringMessageConverter` to convert between String and byte arrays.

It's a good idea to use a message converter when sending and receiving messages. This way, we don't have to worry about converting the message to the correct format.

### 2. use message listeners

Another best practice is to use message listeners. A message listener is a class that implements the `MessageListener` interface. This interface has a single `onMessage` method:

```java
public interface MessageListener {
    void onMessage(Message message);
}
```

This method is called when a message is received. The message is passed in as a parameter.

Message listeners are a good way to handle messages as they're received. We don't have to worry about polling for messages or converting the message to the correct format.

### 3. use a message queue

When using a message broker, it's a good idea to use a message queue. A message queue is a data structure that stores messages. The messages are stored in the order they're received.

A message queue can be used to store messages that need to be processed. For example, we can add messages to a queue as they're received. We can then process the messages in the queue one at a time.

Message queues can be used to improve performance. If we're processing a lot of messages, we can process them in parallel. This way, we don't have to wait for one message to be processed before we start processing the next message.

## Warnings

- Make sure to use the correct message converter when sending and receiving messages. Otherwise, you may get unexpected results.
- Make sure to use the correct message listener when receiving messages. Otherwise, you may miss messages or get unexpected results.

## Dangers

- If you're not using a message queue, your messages may be processed out of order.
- If you're not using a message converter, your messages may not be converted to the correct format.
