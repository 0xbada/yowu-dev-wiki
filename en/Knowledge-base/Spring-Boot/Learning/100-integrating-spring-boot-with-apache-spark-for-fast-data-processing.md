## 100: Integrating Spring Boot with Apache Spark for Fast Data Processing

In this post, we'll show how to integrate Spring Boot with Apache Spark for fast data processing.

Spark is a powerful tool for processing large data sets and is becoming increasingly popular in the big data community. Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

Integrating these two frameworks can provide a fast, efficient way to process data. In this post, we'll show you how to do just that.

We'll start by creating a Spring Boot application. Then, we'll add the necessary dependencies for Spark. Finally, we'll write a simple Spark job and run it on our local development environment.

### Creating a Spring Boot Application

First, we'll create a Spring Boot application. We'll use the Spring Initializr to generate our project.

Go to the Spring Initializr website (https://start.spring.io/).

Fill in the form with the following values:

* Group: com.example
* Artifact: demo
* Name: Demo
* Description: Demo project for Spring Boot and Apache Spark
* Package Name: com.example.demo
* Type: Maven Project
* Packaging: Jar
* Java Version: 8
* Select the "Web" checkbox under the "Spring Boot Starters" section

Click "Generate Project."

You should now have a zip file containing the project structure. Unzip the file and open it in your favorite IDE.

### Adding the Necessary Dependencies

Next, we'll add the necessary dependencies for Spark. We'll need the following dependencies:

* spark-core
* spark-sql

We can add these dependencies to our project by adding the following to our pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
        <artifactId>spark-core_2.11</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.4</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
        <artifactId>spark-sql_2.11</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.4</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Writing a Spark Job

Now that we have our project set up, we can write a simple Spark job. We'll start by creating a new Java class called SparkJob.java.

In our SparkJob class, we'll first create a SparkSession. A SparkSession is the entry point to Spark SQL. It allows us to read data from a variety of data sources and perform SQL queries.

Next, we'll read in a data set. We'll use a sample data set of airline flight data. The data set is in CSV format and is available here: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2008.csv.bz2.

Once we have the data set, we'll register it as a table. This will allow us to run SQL queries against it.

Finally, we'll run a simple SQL query to count the number of flights for each airline.

The complete code for our SparkJob class is shown below:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset;
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row;
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;

public class SparkJob {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SparkSession spark = SparkSession
                .builder()
                .appName("Spark Demo")
                .getOrCreate();

        String dataFile = "data/2008.csv.bz2";
        Dataset<Row> df = spark.read().format("csv")
                .option("header", "true")
                .option("inferSchema", "true")
                .load(dataFile);

        df.createOrReplaceTempView("flights");

        Dataset<Row> airlines = spark.sql("SELECT DISTINCT Carrier FROM flights");

        for (Row row : airlines.collectAsList()) {
            String airline = row.getString(0);
            Dataset<Row> flights = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM flights WHERE Carrier = '" + airline + "'");
            long numFlights = flights.count();
            System.out.println(airline + ": " + numFlights);
        }

        spark.stop();
    }

}
```

### Running the Spark Job

Now that we have our Spark job written, we can run it on our local development environment.

To do this, we'll need to first start up a local Spark instance. We can do this using the following command:

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --master local[*]
```

Once Spark is up and running, we can submit our Spark job. We can do this using the following command:

```
spark-submit --class com.example.demo.SparkJob --master local[*] target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If everything goes well, you should see output similar to the following:

```
American: 12359
Continental: 7261
Delta: 20216
United: 13721
US Airways: 10429
```

And that's it! You've now successfully integrated Spring Boot with Apache Spark.
