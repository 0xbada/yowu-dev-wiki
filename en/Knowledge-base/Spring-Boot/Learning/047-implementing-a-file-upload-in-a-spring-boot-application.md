# Implementing a file upload in a Spring Boot application

In this post, we'll take a look at how to implement a file upload in a Spring Boot application.

We'll start by looking at the @ConfigurationProperties annotation and how it can be used to configure file uploads in Spring Boot. We'll then create a simple HTML form that allows users to select a file to upload. Finally, we'll implement a controller that handles the file upload and saves the file to a directory on the server.

## Configuring file uploads in Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides a number of properties that can be used to configure file uploads in a Spring Boot application. These properties are prefixed with ```spring.servlet.multipart.```.

The most important property is ```spring.servlet.multipart.enabled```. This property must be set to ```true``` to enable file uploads in Spring Boot.

The next property is ```spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold```. This property specifies the size threshold for files that will be stored in memory. Files that are larger than this threshold will be written to a temporary file on disk.

The last property we'll look at is ```spring.servlet.multipart.location```. This property specifies the location on the server where uploaded files will be stored. This location must be a directory that is writable by the user that the application is running as.

## Creating an HTML form for file uploads

Now that we've configured Spring Boot for file uploads, we need to create an HTML form that allows users to select a file to upload.

The form should have a ```file``` input field and a ```submit``` button. The ```file``` input field should have the ```multiple``` attribute set to ```true```. This will allow users to select multiple files to upload.

The ```action``` attribute of the ```form``` element should be set to the URL of the controller that will handle the file upload. The ```method``` attribute should be set to ```POST```.

## Implementing the file upload controller

Now that we have a form for uploading files, we need to implement a controller that handles the file upload.

The controller should have a ```@PostMapping``` annotation with the value ```/upload```. This will map the URL ```/upload``` to the controller method.

The controller method should have a ```@RequestParam``` annotation with the value ```file```. This will bind the ```file``` input field to a ```MultipartFile``` object.

The controller method should also have a ```@ResponseBody``` annotation. This will cause the controller method to return the contents of the uploaded file as the response to the request.

Finally, the controller method should have a ```@RequestMapping``` annotation with the value ```/upload```. This will map the URL ```/upload``` to the controller method.

## Saving the uploaded file

Once the file has been uploaded, we need to save it to the directory that we configured earlier. We can do this by calling the ```transferTo()``` method on the ```MultipartFile``` object.

The ```transferTo()``` method takes a ```File``` object as an argument. We can create a ```File``` object by concatenating the configured location with the original filename of the uploaded file.

Once the file has been transferred, we can return a ```ResponseEntity``` object with a ```201``` status code to indicate that the file was successfully uploaded.

We've started by looking at the @ConfigurationProperties annotation and how it can be used to configure file uploads in Spring Boot. We've then created a simple HTML form that allows users to select a file to upload.
