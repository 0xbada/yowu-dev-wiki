# Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for Distributed Systems

The cloud has become the new normal for many businesses and organizations. It’s cost-effective, scalable, and provides a number of other benefits. But it can also be complex, with a lot of moving parts.

One way to make developing distributed systems on the cloud easier is to use Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. In this article, we’ll take a look at what these two frameworks are and how they can be used together.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a framework that helps you create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It’s designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal configuration.

Spring Boot comes with a number of features, including:

- Embedded servers which make it easy to deploy your applications
- Support for many different data sources
- A large number ofstarter dependencies, which can be used to add common dependencies to your project with a minimum of configuration
- Automatic configuration of Spring beans
- Opinionated but flexible configuration

Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered applications and services. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and gets you up and running with the minimum of configuration.

## What is Spring Cloud?

Spring Cloud is a set of tools for building cloud-native applications. It provides a number of features, including:

- Service Discovery: A mechanism for registering and discovering services
- Configuration Management: A distributed configuration service
- Routing: A reverse proxy service for routing requests to backend services
- Load Balancing: A client-side load balancing library
- Circuit Breakers: A library for managing faults in distributed systems

Spring Cloud helps you build cloud-native applications that are scalable, resilient, and manage themselves.

## Using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Together

Spring Boot and Spring Cloud work well together. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications, and Spring Cloud makes it easy to build and deploy microservices.

Here’s a simple example of a microservice built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class MyService {
    
    @Autowired
    private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;
    
    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello from MyService";
    }
    
    @RequestMapping("/service-instances/{applicationName}")
    public List<ServiceInstance> serviceInstancesByApplicationName(
        @PathVariable String applicationName) {
        return this.discoveryClient.getInstances(applicationName);
    }
}
```

This microservice registers itself with a Spring Cloud DiscoveryClient, which allows it to be discovered by other services. It also exposes two REST endpoints: one for returning a simple greeting, and one for returning a list of ServiceInstances for a given application name.

To run this microservice, you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

You can then access the microservice at http://localhost:8080.

##Conclusion

In this article, we’ve looked at what Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are and how they can be used together. We’ve also seen a simple example of a microservice built with these two frameworks.

If you’re looking for a way to simplify developing distributed systems on the cloud, then Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are worth checking out.
