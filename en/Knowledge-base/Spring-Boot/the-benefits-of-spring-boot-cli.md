# The Benefits of Spring Boot CLI 

The Spring Boot command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that can be used to quickly create and run Spring-based applications. It is also a great tool for learning Spring and for prototyping new ideas. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the benefits of using the Spring Boot CLI.

## 1. Create Spring-based Applications Quickly and Easily

One of the biggest benefits of using the Spring Boot CLI is that it makes it quick and easy to create Spring-based applications. There is no need to install and configure a separate Spring tool suite. All you need is the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Spring Boot CLI.

Once you have the JDK and Spring Boot CLI installed, you can create a new Spring Boot application by running the following command:

```
$ spring boot my-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-app` with the basic structure of a Spring Boot application. You can then navigate into this directory and run the application with the following command:

```
$ cd my-app
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The Spring Boot CLI makes it easy to create Spring-based applications with just a few commands.

## 2. Run Spring Applications

In addition to creating Spring-based applications, the Spring Boot CLI can also be used to run Spring applications. This is especially useful for testing and debugging purposes. For example, you can use the following command to run a Spring application in debug mode:

```
$ spring boot --debug my-app
```

You can also use the Spring Boot CLI to run Spring applications in aproduction environment. This can be done by using the `--prod` flag when running the application:

```
$ spring boot --prod my-app
```

## 3. Learn Spring

The Spring Boot CLI is also a great tool for learning Spring. The `spring` command can be used to get information about various Spring features. For example, you can use the following command to get information about the Bean Definition Dsl:

```
$ spring bean-dsl
```

You can also use the `spring help` command to get a list of all the available commands:

```
$ spring help
```

## 4. Prototype New Ideas

Another great benefit of the Spring Boot CLI is that it can be used to quickly prototype new ideas. For example, if you want to try out a new Spring feature, you can use the Spring Boot CLI to create a new application and test it out without having to install and configure a separate Spring tool suite.

Conclusion

The Spring Boot CLI is a powerful tool that can be used to quickly create and run Spring-based applications. It is also a great tool for learning Spring and for prototyping new ideas.
