# Spring Boot Deployment on Cloud Foundry

Developers looking to deploy Spring Boot-based applications on Cloud Foundry have a few different options. In this article, we'll take a look at a few of these options and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.

## Packaging as a Jar

One option for packaging a Spring Boot application is to package it as a jar file. This is the recommended approach in the Spring Boot documentation.

To package a Spring Boot application as a jar, you will need to use the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` plugin. This plugin will package your application as an executable jar file. You can then deploy this jar file to Cloud Foundry using the `cf push` command.

One advantage of packaging your application as a jar is that you can easily run it locally using the `java -jar` command. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.

Another advantage of packaging as a jar is that you can specify any environment variables that your application needs in the `manifest.yml` file. This can be helpful if you want to avoid hard-coding any environment-specific values in your code.

## Packaging as a War

Another option for packaging a Spring Boot application is to package it as a war file. This is not the recommended approach in the Spring Boot documentation, but it is an option.

To package a Spring Boot application as a war, you will need to use the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency. This dependency will include all of the necessary libraries for packaging your application as a war.

You can then deploy this war file to Cloud Foundry using the `cf push` command. One advantage of packaging as a war is that you can specify any environment variables that your application needs in the `manifest.yml` file. This can be helpful if you want to avoid hard-coding any environment-specific values in your code.

## Using the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack

Cloud Foundry provides a Java buildpack that can be used to deploy Spring Boot applications. This buildpack will detect that your application is a Spring Boot application and will configure it accordingly.

To use the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack, you will need to specify the `java_buildpack` as the buildpack for your application in the `manifest.yml` file. You can then deploy your application using the `cf push` command.

One advantage of using the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack is that you don't need to package your application in a jar or war file. The buildpack will do that for you.

Another advantage of using the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack is that you can specify any environment variables that your application needs in the `manifest.yml` file. This can be helpful if you want to avoid hard-coding any environment-specific values in your code.

## Using the Spring Cloud Connectors

The Spring Cloud Connectors provide an abstraction layer that allows you to use any Cloud Foundry service with a Spring application. This can be helpful if you want to use a service that is not currently supported by the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack.

To use the Spring Cloud Connectors, you will need to add the `spring-cloud-spring-service-connector` dependency to your project. You can then deploy your application using the `cf push` command.

One advantage of using the Spring Cloud Connectors is that you don't need to package your application in a jar or war file. The buildpack will do that for you.

Another advantage of using the Spring Cloud Connectors is that you can specify any environment variables that your application needs in the `manifest.yml` file. This can be helpful if you want to avoid hard-coding any environment-specific values in your code.

## Conclusion

There are a few different options for deploying Spring Boot applications on Cloud Foundry. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you to decide which option is best for your application.
