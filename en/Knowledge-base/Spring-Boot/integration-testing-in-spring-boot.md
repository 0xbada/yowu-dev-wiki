# Integration Testing in Spring Boot

In this article, we'll take a look at integration testing in Spring Boot. We'll discuss what it is, why it's important, and how to do it. We'll also provide some code examples to help you get started.

## What is integration testing?

Integration testing is a type of testing that checks for the proper interaction between different software components. In other words, it verifies that the components are able to work together as intended.

It's important to note that integration testing is different from unit testing. Unit testing focuses on testing individual software components in isolation. Integration testing, on the other hand, focuses on testing the interaction between components.

## Why is integration testing important?

Integration testing is important because it helps ensure that the different software components in your system are able to work together as intended.

If you don't perform integration testing, you run the risk of encountering problems when the components are actually used together in the system. This can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, and even system crashes.

## How to do integration testing in Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to do integration testing with your application. In this section, we'll take a look at how to do it.

### 1. Create a test case

The first thing you need to do is create a test case. A test case is a class that contains one or more test methods. Each test method is responsible for testing a specific aspect of the system.

In Spring Boot, you can use the @Test annotation to mark a method as a test method. For example:

```java
@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Inject dependencies

Next, you need to inject any dependencies that the test method needs. For example, if the test method needs to access a database, you would inject a DataSource bean.

You can inject dependencies into a test method using the @Autowired annotation. For example:

```java
@Autowired
private DataSource dataSource;

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Perform assertions

After you've executed the code under test, you need to perform assertions to verify that the code behaves as expected. For example, you might assert that a certain value is returned from a method call.

In Spring Boot, you can use the Assert class to perform assertions. For example:

```java
@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // Execute code under test
    int result = someMethod();

    // Perform assertion
    Assert.assertEquals(expected, result);
}
```

### 4. Run the test

Once you've created your test case, you can run it using the Spring Boot Test Runner. The Test Runner will execute all of the tests in your test case and generate a report.

You can run the Test Runner from the command line using the following command:

```
./mvnw test
```
