# Spring Boot in the Cloud

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services). It is a service that doesn’t require users to have any knowledge of, or control over, the underlying technology infrastructure. 

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can "just run". It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and gets you up and running as quickly as possible.

In this post, we'll look at how to deploy a Spring Boot application to the cloud using Platform as a Service (PaaS). We'll also take a look at some of the benefits and drawbacks of using PaaS.

## What is Platform as a Service?

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developers to build, test, and deploy applications. PaaS providers offer a platform, typically including operating system, programming language runtime, database, web server, and middleware, that can be used to develop and run an application.

PaaS can be used to deploy applications to the cloud without the need to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure. This can simplify the process of deployment and make it more cost-effective, as the PaaS provider will typically offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

PaaS can also make it easier to scale an application, as the underlying infrastructure can be easily scaled up or down as needed.

## Benefits of Using PaaS

There are a number of benefits to using PaaS:

- PaaS can make it easier to deploy and manage applications in the cloud.
- PaaS can make it easier to scale applications.
- PaaS can provide a cost-effective way to deploy and run applications.
- PaaS can offer a variety of services that can be used to develop and run applications.

## Drawbacks of Using PaaS

There are also some drawbacks to using PaaS:

- PaaS providers can lock you into their platform, making it more difficult to move to a different provider or to run your application on-premises.
- PaaS providers can control the underlying infrastructure, which can make it more difficult to customize or optimize your environment.
- PaaS providers can change their offerings, which can impact your application.

## Deploying a Spring Boot Application to the Cloud

Now that we've looked at some of the benefits and drawbacks of using PaaS, let's take a look at how to deploy a Spring Boot application to the cloud.

We'll be using the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) PaaS for this example. Heroku offers a free tier that can be used for development and testing applications.

### Prerequisites

Before we can deploy our Spring Boot application to Heroku, we need to do a few things:

- Create a Heroku account
- Install the Heroku CLI
- Create a Procfile

#### Creating a Heroku Account

The first thing we need to do is create a Heroku account. We can do this by going to the [Heroku signup page](https://signup.heroku.com/).

Once we've signed up for a Heroku account, we can log in to the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

#### Installing the Heroku CLI

Next, we need to install the Heroku CLI. The Heroku CLI is a command line interface that can be used to manage Heroku applications.

We can install the Heroku CLI by following the instructions on the [Heroku CLI download page](https://cli.heroku.com/).

Once the Heroku CLI is installed, we can verify that it is working by running the following command:

```
$ heroku --version
```

#### Creating a Procfile

A Procfile is a text file that contains instructions for Heroku on how to run our application.

Our Procfile will need to contain the following line:

```
web: java -jar target/my-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This tells Heroku to run our application as a web server using the Java runtime.

## Deploying the Application

Now that we've done the necessary setup, we're ready to deploy our application.

We can deploy our application by running the following command from the root directory of our project:

```
$ heroku create
```

This will create a new Heroku application and set up a remote repository for our project.

Next, we can deploy our application by running the following command:

```
$ git push heroku master
```

This will push our code to the Heroku remote repository and trigger a deployment.

Once the deployment is complete, we can open our application in a web browser by running the following command:

```
$ heroku open
```
