# Spring Boot and Spring Security for Secure Web Applications

Developing a secure web application is a top priority for any organization. In this article, we'll look at how to use Spring Boot and Spring Security to create a simple and secure web application.

We'll first create a Spring Boot application with a basic security configuration. Then we'll add a few Spring Security features to secure our application.

## Creating a Spring Boot Application

We'll start by creating a Spring Boot application. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run".

We'll use the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to create our project. We'll select the following dependencies:

- Web
- Security

We'll name our project `secure-web-app`.

Once the project is generated, we can import it into our favorite IDE and run it as a Spring Boot application.

## Basic Security Configuration

Spring Security is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks.

By default, Spring Security is not configured. We can add a basic configuration by adding the following to our `application.properties` file:

```
spring.security.user.name=user
spring.security.user.password=password
```

This will create a user with the username `user` and password `password`.

We can also add a more comprehensive configuration by creating a `SecurityConfig.java` file.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .and()
            .httpBasic();
    }
}
```

This will configure Spring Security to require authentication for all requests and to use form login and HTTP Basic authentication.

## Adding Spring Security Features

Now that we have a basic Spring Security configuration in place, we can add some additional features.

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious user tricks a victim into submitting a request to a web application that they are logged in to.

Spring Security provides CSRF protection by default. We can configure it by adding the following to our `SecurityConfig.java` file:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            ...
    }
}
```

This will disable CSRF protection.

### Security Headers

We can also add security headers to our responses to help protect against common attacks.

We can add the following to our `SecurityConfig.java` file:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .headers()
                .contentSecurityPolicy("script-src 'self'");
    }
}
```

This will add the `Content-Security-Policy` header to our responses.

We can also add the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to enforce HTTPS:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .requiresChannel()
                .requestMatchers(r -> r.getHeader("X-Forwarded-Proto") != null)
                .requiresSecure();
    }
}
```

This will require HTTPS for all requests that contain the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header.

### Authentication Providers

Spring Security supports multiple authentication providers. We can add support for additional providers by overriding the `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder)` method:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
            .inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser("user").password("password").roles("USER");
    }

    ...
}
```

This will configure an in-memory authentication provider with a single user.

We can also add support for [JDBC-based authentication](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/#jc-authentication-jdbc).

## Conclusion

In this article, we've looked at how to use Spring Boot and Spring Security to create a simple and secure web application. We've also added some additional security features to help protect our application.
