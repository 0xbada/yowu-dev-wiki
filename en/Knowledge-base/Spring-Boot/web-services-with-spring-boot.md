# Web Services with Spring Boot

In this article we will discuss how to develop web services using Spring Boot.

Spring Boot provides a wide range of features to develop web applications quickly and easily. It provides an opinionated approach to configure a complete web application. It also reduces the boilerplate configuration code.

Spring Boot provides a number of built-in features that can be used to develop web services.

## Web Services with Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides a number of features to develop web services.

### RESTful Web Services

Spring Boot provides first-class support for developing RESTful web services.

It uses a number of well-known projects to provide a complete web service stack. These include:

* [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) - an open-source HTTP server and servlet container
* [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) - a fast and powerful JSON library
* [JPA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html) - the Java Persistence API

Spring Boot provides a number of features to make it easy to develop RESTful web services.

#### Automatic Configuration

Spring Boot can automatically configure a lot of the infrastructure for a web application. This includes the web server, [data source](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html), [security](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-security.html), and [logging](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-logging.html).

All you need to do is add the required dependencies to your project, and Spring Boot will automatically configure everything for you.

#### Embedded Tomcat

Spring Boot can automatically configure and start an embedded Tomcat instance. This means that you don't need to deploy your application to an external Tomcat instance.

#### JPA

Spring Boot can automatically configure a JPA entity manager. This makes it very easy to develop web services that use a database.

#### Security

Spring Boot can automatically configure security for your web application. This makes it very easy to add security to your web services.

#### Logging

Spring Boot can automatically configure logging for your web application. This makes it very easy to add logging to your web services.

## Developing Web Services with Spring Boot

Developing web services with Spring Boot is very easy.

First, you need to add the required dependencies to your project. For example, if you want to develop a RESTful web service that uses JPA, you would need to add the following dependencies to your project:

* spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
* spring-boot-starter-web

Second, you need to create a Spring Boot application class. This class is used to configure your application. For example, if you want to develop a RESTful web service, you would need to annotate your application class with the @RestController annotation.

Third, you need to write your web service methods. These methods will handle the requests and responses for your web service.

 fourth, you need to build and run your application. Spring Boot will automatically configure and start an embedded Tomcat instance.

That's all you need to do to develop a web service with Spring Boot.

## Summary

In this article we discussed how to develop web services using Spring Boot. Spring Boot provides a number of features to make it easy to develop web services. These features include automatic configuration, embedded Tomcat, JPA, security, and logging.
