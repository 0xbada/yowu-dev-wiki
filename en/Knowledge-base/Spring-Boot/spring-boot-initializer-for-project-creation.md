# Spring Boot Initializer for Project Creation

Developing a new project can be time-consuming, especially when starting from scratch. Spring Boot makes it easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run". It provides a flexible build system and application server that can be configured easily.

In this article, we will show you how to use Spring Boot Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project. Spring Boot Initializr is a web application that can generate a Spring Boot project. It provides options to select the dependencies that you need for the project.

## What is Spring Boot Initializr?

Spring Boot Initializr is a web application that can generate a Spring Boot project. It provides options to select the dependencies that you need for the project.

The generated project includes the selected dependencies and can be built with the Gradle or Maven build tool. It also includes the necessary configuration files for the application server (if any) and the build tool.
