# Debugging and Profiling in Spring Boot

Developing software can be difficult and time-consuming. It's important to have tools that can help make the process as smooth as possible. In this article, we'll take a look at two such tools: debugging and profiling.

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software. It can be used to find errors in both the code and the data. Profiling is a technique that can be used to optimize software. It can be used to find bottlenecks and to improve performance.

Spring Boot is a popular framework for developing web applications. It makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run". It also provides a variety of tools to help with debugging and profiling.

## Debugging Spring Boot Applications

There are a few different ways to debug Spring Boot applications. In this section, we'll take a look at two of the most popular: using the spring-boot-devtools module, and using remote debugging.

### Using the spring-boot-devtools module

The spring-boot-devtools module can be used to improve the debugging experience. It provides features such as auto-restart, live reload, and remote debugging.

To use the spring-boot-devtools module, add it to your project as a dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Once you've done that, you can enable the features of the module by adding the following properties to your application.properties file:

```
spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true
spring.devtools.livereload.enabled=true
spring.devtools.remote.debug.local=false
```

The first property, spring.devtools.restart.enabled, enables the auto-restart feature. This feature will automatically restart the application when files in the classpath are changed. The second property, spring.devtools.livereload.enabled, enables the live reload feature. This feature will reload resources that have changed without restarting the application.

The third property, spring.devtools.remote.debug.local, enables remote debugging. This feature will allow you to debug the application from a remote IDE. To use this feature, you'll need to set the value of the property to true and add the following property:

```
spring.devtools.remote.debug.port=8000
```

This property sets the port that will be used for remote debugging. Once you've done that, you can start the application in debug mode. In IntelliJ IDEA, you can do this by going to Run -> Edit Configurations. In the Edit Configurations dialog, click the + button and select Remote. In the Remote Configuration dialog, set the port to 8000 and click Apply.

You can now debug the application from IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, open the Debug tool window and click the + button. In the Add Configuration dialog, select Remote and click OK. In the Remote Configuration dialog, set the port to 8000 and click Debug.

### Using remote debugging

If you're using a different IDE, you can still use remote debugging. To do this, you'll need to start the application in debug mode and specify the port that will be used for debugging. In IntelliJ IDEA, you can do this by going to Run -> Edit Configurations. In the Edit Configurations dialog, click the + button and select Remote. In the Remote Configuration dialog, set the port to 8000 and click Apply.

You can now debug the application from IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, open the Debug tool window and click the + button. In the Add Configuration dialog, select Remote and click OK. In the Remote Configuration dialog, set the port to 8000 and click Debug.

## Profiling Spring Boot Applications

Profiling is a technique that can be used to optimize software. It can be used to find bottlenecks and to improve performance. There are a few different ways to profile Spring Boot applications. In this section, we'll take a look at two of the most popular: using the Spring Boot Actuator, and using JProfiler.

### Using the Spring Boot Actuator

The Spring Boot Actuator is a set of tools that can be used to monitor and manage a Spring Boot application. It provides a number of features, including a web interface, endpoints for monitoring and managing the application, and a set of tools for gathering profiling information.

To use the Spring Boot Actuator, add it to your project as a dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Once you've done that, you can access the web interface by going to http://localhost:8080/actuator. The web interface provides a number of different tools for monitoring and managing the application. It also provides a set of tools for gathering profiling information.

To use the profiling tools, you'll need to add the following property to your application.properties file:

```
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

This property will expose all of the Actuator's endpoints. Once you've done that, you can access the /profiler endpoint. This endpoint will allow you to collect and view profiling information.

### Using JProfiler

JProfiler is a Java profiling tool. It can be used to collect a variety of different types of information, including thread information, memory information, and SQL information. It also provides a number of different views, including a call tree view, a hot spot view, and a live memory view.

To use JProfiler, you'll need to install it and add it to your project as a dependency. You can do this by going to the JProfiler website and downloading the latest version. Once you've done that, you can add it to your project as a dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jprofiler</groupId>
    <artifactId>jprofiler</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.2</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Once you've done that, you can start the application in profile mode. In IntelliJ IDEA, you can do this by going to Run -> Edit Configurations. In the Edit Configurations dialog, click the + button and select Profile. In the Profile Configuration dialog, select the JProfiler option and click Apply.

You can now profile the application from IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, open the Profile tool window and select the profiling session that you want to use. In the session, you can select the data that you want to collect and the views that you want to use.
