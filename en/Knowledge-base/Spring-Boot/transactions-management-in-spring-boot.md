## Transactional Management in Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides several options for transactional management. This post explains each option and provides a code example for each option.

### 1. JTA with Atomikos

JTA with Atomikos is the most recommended option for transactional management in Spring Boot. Atomikos is a transaction manager that supports JTA. JTA is a standard Java API for managing transactions.

To use JTA with Atomikos, you need to add the following dependencies to your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jta-atomikos</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And you need to configure Atomikos in your application.properties file:

```
spring.jta.atomikos.properties.logbase=java.io.tmpdir
spring.jta.atomikos.properties.service=com.atomikos.icatch.standalone.UserTransactionServiceFactory
```

You can find more information about configuring Atomikos in the [Atomikos documentation](https://docs.atomikos.com/Main/ConfiguringTheTransactionService).

### 2. LocalTransactionManager

The LocalTransactionManager is a simple transaction manager that can be used for transactional management in Spring Boot. To use the LocalTransactionManager, you need to add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

```

And you need to configure the LocalTransactionManager in your application.properties file:

```
spring.jta.transaction-manager-id=localTransactionManager
```

```
spring.jta.bitronix.tm-unique-name=bitronixTransactionManager
```
