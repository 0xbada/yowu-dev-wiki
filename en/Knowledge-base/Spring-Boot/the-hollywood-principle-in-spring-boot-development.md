# Introduction

The Hollywood Principle is a software development principle that states that "dependencies should be inverted". In other words, high-level components should not depend on low-level components; rather, low-level components should depend on high-level components.

The principle is named after the Hollywood Principle, which states that "in show business, the audience should never see the behind-the-scenes workings". In other words, the audience should only see the finished product, not the process of how it was made.

The Hollywood Principle is often used in conjunction with the Dependency Inversion Principle, which states that "dependencies should be inverted". In other words, high-level components should not depend on low-level components; rather, low-level components should depend on high-level components.
