# What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications. It is designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of a new Spring application. 

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

# Why use Spring Boot?

Spring Boot provides a number of features that make it easy to develop Spring applications.

- It provides a flexible configuration that can be overridden as required.
- It provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- It provides a wide range of starter dependencies that can be included in your application, making it easier to get started.
- It provides a CLI tool that can be used to quickly create and run Spring applications.

# Getting Started

The best way to get started with Spring Boot is to use the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). This is a web-based tool that can be used to create a new Spring Boot application. 

Simply select the dependencies you need for your application, and the Initializr will generate a project skeleton for you. You can then download the project, and import it into your favorite IDE.

# Creating a Spring Boot Application

Once you have the Initializr up and running, creating a new Spring Boot application is simple. Just select the dependencies you need, and download the project. 

You can then import the project into your favorite IDE, and start coding. The Initializr will create a simple `HelloWorld` application for you that you can use to get started.

# Conclusion

Spring Boot is a great way to get started with Spring. It provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications. It is also opinionated, so it makes it easy to get started with minimum fuss.
