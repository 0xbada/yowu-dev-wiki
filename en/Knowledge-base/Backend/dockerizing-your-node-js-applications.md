# Dockerizing Your Node.js Applications

More and more developers are beginning to use Docker to help with the development and deployment process of their applications. It is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to simplify the process and enable developers to quickly and efficiently deploy and manage their applications. This can also be applied to Node.js applications, and there are a few steps that need to be taken to run an Node.js application in a Docker environment.

## What is Docker?

At its core, Docker is a container platform used to create and deploy applications. It works by creating isolated environments for an application container that is isolated from the main host system. This allows for applications to be quickly and easily deployed and managed on different host systems, regardless of the system configuration. This makes it much more efficient for developers to manage and deploy their applications, as instead of having to configure each separate host system, they only have to configure Docker.

## Benefits of Dockerizing Your Node.js Application

When Dockerizing your Node.js application, you can reap a lot of benefits. By using Docker, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to set up and deploy applications, and make it much easier to maintain them. This can be especially useful for larger projects, as it allows you to easily make changes across multiple servers, or even multiple environments such as development, test and production. Additionally, Docker allows for easy scaling of applications by allowing multiple containers to be created and managed.

## Basic Steps For Dockerizing Your Node.js Application

Before getting started, you will need to install both Node.js and the Docker Engine. After that, the basic steps for Dockerizing your Node.js application are as follows.

1. Create a Docker image.
2. Add the Node.js application code to the image.
3. Add a `package.json` to the image's root directory to specify the Node.js version and project dependencies. 
4. Add a Dockerfile to define the commands used to build the image, install dependencies and start the application.
5. Run the `docker build` command to create the Docker image.
6. Run the `docker run` command to start the application container.
7. Access your application from the browser by connecting to the Docker container's IP address.

## Testing and Troubleshooting

Once your application is running in a Docker container, you can use the containerâ€™s `logs` to review what is happening. Additionally, you can also use the `docker

exec` command to open a shell session inside your container and check for any errors. This can be especially useful for debugging your application.

## Summary 

Dockerizing your Node.js application can be a great way to improve your development and deployment process. By using Docker to package and manage your application, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to set up and deploy applications, and make it much easier to maintain them. Additionally, Docker allows for easy scaling of applications by allowing multiple containers to be created and managed. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can quickly and easily Dockerize your Node.js application.
