# Getting Started with Kotlin for Backend Development

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript, and Native. It is developed by JetBrains. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version can run any Java code. Kotlin is released under the Apache 2 open source license.

According to JetBrains, over 60% of Kotlin projects use the language for backend development. The reasons for this are numerous: Kotlin is concise, safe, Null-Pointer-Proof™, and has great tooling support. It is also 100% interoperable with Java, meaning that you can use all existing Java libraries in your Kotlin code.

In this article, we'll take a look at how to get started with Kotlin for backend development. We'll see how to set up a Kotlin project, write code in Kotlin, and run it on the JVM.

## Setting up a Kotlin Project

There are many ways to set up a Kotlin project. In this article, we'll use the Gradle build tool. Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multiple languages. Kotlin projects can be easily created using the Gradle Kotlin DSL.

The first thing we need to do is create a file called `build.gradle.kts` in the root of our project. This file contains the configuration for our Kotlin project.

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.3.72"
}

group = "com.example"
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8")
}

tasks.withType<Test> {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

In the `build.gradle.kts` file, we've configured the Kotlin plugin and added a dependency on the Kotlin stdlib. We've also configured the `test` task to use the JUnit platform.

## Writing Kotlin Code

Now that we have a Kotlin project set up, we can write some Kotlin code. We'll start by creating a file called `Main.kt` in the `src/` directory.

In `Main.kt`, we'll write a simple Kotlin program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Kotlin programs start with a `main` function. The `main` function is the entry point for our program. In the `main` function, we've printed the string "Hello, world!" to the console.

## Running Kotlin Code

Kotlin code can be run on the JVM without any additional configuration. To run our Kotlin program, we can use the `gradle run` command. This will compile our Kotlin code and run the `main` function.

```
$ gradle run

> Task :run
Hello, world!

## Conclusion

In this article, we've seen how to get started with Kotlin for backend development. We've set up a Kotlin project, written some Kotlin code, and run it on the JVM. Kotlin is a great language for backend development, and we've only scratched the surface of what it can do.
