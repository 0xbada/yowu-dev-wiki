Microservices are an architectural style in which large, complex software applications are composed of one or more smaller services. Each service is responsible for a specific function and runs in its own process. These services communicate with each other over a network, usually using a lightweight, language-agnostic protocol such as HTTP.

The benefits of using microservices include improved modularity, scalability, and availability. In addition, microservices allow for different parts of an application to be developed and deployed independently.

However, there are some challenges that come with using microservices. These include increased complexity, difficulty in debugging, and the need for more inter-service communication.

Containers and micro VMs are two technologies that can be used to overcome some of the challenges associated with microservices.

Containers are a type of virtualization that allows for isolation of applications and their dependencies. This means that each application can run in its own container without affecting other applications.

Micro VMs are even smaller than containers, allowing for even more isolation of applications. In addition, micro VMs can be used to run multiple applications on the same physical machine.

Both containers and micro VMs have their own pros and cons, and the decision of which to use will depend on the specific needs of the application.

### Containers

#### Pros

- Isolation of applications and their dependencies
- Portability across different machines
- Resource utilization

#### Cons

- Increased complexity
- Difficulty in debugging

### Micro VMs

#### Pros

- Isolation of applications
- Ability to run multiple applications on the same physical machine

#### Cons

-Increased complexity
- Difficulty in debugging
- Performance overhead
