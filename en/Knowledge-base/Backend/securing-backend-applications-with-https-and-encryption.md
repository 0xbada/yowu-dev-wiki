# Securing Backend Applications with HTTPS and Encryption

The internet has become an essential part of our daily lives. We use it for work, entertainment, shopping, and communication. As we become more reliant on the internet, the need for security increases.

There are many ways to secure backend applications. In this article, we will focus on two methods: HTTPS and encryption.

## HTTPS

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a protocol used to communicate between a web browser and a web server. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication.

SSL/TLS is a protocol that provides security for communication over the internet. It uses two keys to encrypt data: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt data.

When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser will check to see if the website's SSL certificate is valid. If the certificate is valid, the browser will create a secure connection with the server.

HTTPS is important for security because it prevents attackers from eavesdropping on communication between the browser and server. HTTPS also protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Encryption

Encryption is a process of transforming readable data into an unreadable format. Encryption is important for security because it prevents attackers from reading sensitive data.

There are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. The key must be kept secret to prevent attackers from decrypting the data.

Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt data. The keys are generated together and the private key must be kept secret.

Encryption is important for security because it prevents attackers from reading sensitive data. Encryption is also important for privacy because it prevents data from being read by anyone other than the intended recipient.

## Conclusion

HTTPS and encryption are important for security and privacy. HTTPS provides security by encrypting communication between the browser and server. Encryption provides security by preventing attackers from reading sensitive data.
