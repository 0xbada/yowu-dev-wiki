# Monitoring and Logging in Infrastructure Development

As a developer, it is important to be aware of the different tools available for monitoring and logging in infrastructure development. This article will provide an overview of some of the most popular tools and discuss their benefits and drawbacks.

## Nagios

Nagios is a popular open source monitoring tool. It can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications. Nagios is highly configurable and can be used to monitor various aspects of your infrastructure.

Nagios has a number of benefits, including:

- Nagios is open source and therefore free to use.

- Nagios is highly configurable, allowing you to monitor different aspects of your infrastructure.

- Nagios can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications.

However, Nagios also has some drawbacks, including:

- Nagios can be difficult to configure.

- Nagios can be resource intensive, and therefore may not be suitable for large infrastructures.

## Zabbix

Zabbix is another popular open source monitoring tool. Like Nagios, it can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications. Zabbix is also highly configurable, allowing you to monitor different aspects of your infrastructure.

Zabbix has a number of benefits, including:

- Zabbix is open source and therefore free to use.

- Zabbix is highly configurable, allowing you to monitor different aspects of your infrastructure.

- Zabbix can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications.

However, Zabbix also has some drawbacks, including:

- Zabbix can be difficult to configure.

- Zabbix can be resource intensive, and therefore may not be suitable for large infrastructures.

## SolarWinds

SolarWinds is a commercial monitoring tool. It can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications. SolarWinds is highly configurable and can be used to monitor different aspects of your infrastructure.

SolarWinds has a number of benefits, including:

- SolarWinds is highly configurable, allowing you to monitor different aspects of your infrastructure.

- SolarWinds can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications.

- SolarWinds offers a wide range of features, making it a comprehensive monitoring solution.

However, SolarWinds also has some drawbacks, including:

- SolarWinds is a commercial tool and therefore requires a subscription.

- SolarWinds can be resource intensive, and therefore may not be suitable for large infrastructures.

## Nagios vs. Zabbix

Nagios and Zabbix are both popular open source monitoring tools. Both tools can be used to monitor servers, networks, and applications. Both tools are highly configurable, allowing you to monitor different aspects of your infrastructure.

However, Nagios and Zabbix also have some differences, including:

- Nagios can be difficult to configure, while Zabbix is easier to configure.

- Zabbix is more resource efficient than Nagios, and therefore may be more suitable for large infrastructures.

- SolarWinds offers more features than Nagios and Zabbix, making it a more comprehensive monitoring solution.
