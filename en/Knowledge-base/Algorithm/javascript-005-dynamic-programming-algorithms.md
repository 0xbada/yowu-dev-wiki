# JavaScript 005: Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Dynamic programming algorithms are a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into subproblems. By solving the subproblems and storing the results, the overall problem can be solved much faster.

There are two main types of dynamic programming algorithms: top-down and bottom-up.

## Top-Down

Top-down algorithms start at the top of the problem and break it down into smaller subproblems. They then solve the subproblems and store the results. When a subproblem has already been solved, the stored result is used instead of solving the subproblem again.

Top-down algorithms are often easier to understand, but can be slower and use more memory than bottom-up algorithms.

## Bottom-Up

Bottom-up algorithms start at the bottom of the problem and work their way up. They solve the subproblems first and then use the results to solve the overall problem.

Bottom-up algorithms can be faster and use less memory than top-down algorithms, but they can be harder to understand.

## Code Example

Here is a simple example of a top-down dynamic programming algorithm written in JavaScript.

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  // Base case: Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
 
  // Recursive case: Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

## Exercise

Try implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm for the Fibonacci sequence.

## Answer Code

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  // Base case: Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
 
  // Recursive case: Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

## Commentary

Both top-down and bottom-up dynamic programming algorithms are powerful tools that can help you solve problems more efficiently. In many cases, a bottom-up approach will be more efficient, but a top-down approach can be easier to understand.
