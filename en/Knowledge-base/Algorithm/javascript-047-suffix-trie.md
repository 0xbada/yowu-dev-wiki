# JavaScript 047: Suffix Trie

A suffix trie is a tree-like data structure that is used to store all the suffixes of a given string in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the suffixes.

The suffix trie is a special case of the more general trie data structure, which is used to store strings in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the strings.

The suffix trie is a particularly efficient data structure for storing and retrieving suffixes, due to the fact that the suffixes of a string can be stored in a compressed form.

The suffix trie data structure has a number of applications, including:

- storing and retrieving the suffixes of a given string
- storing and retrieving the substrings of a given string
- storing and retrieving the longest common subsequences of a given string

The suffix trie data structure can be used to store and retrieve the suffixes of a given string in a way that is both space-efficient and time-efficient.

The suffix trie data structure can be used to store and retrieve the substrings of a given string in a way that is both space-efficient and time-efficient.
