# JavaScript 048: Suffix Array

A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. It is a data structure that is used to facilitate fast string operations, such as pattern matching, pattern search, and pattern matching.

The suffix array can be constructed in O(n) time and space, where n is the length of the string.

## Construction

The construction of the suffix array is a two-step process:

1. Sort the suffixes in lexicographical order
2. Construct the suffix array

The first step can be done in O(n log n) time using a comparison-based sorting algorithm, such as quicksort.

The second step can be done in O(n) time using a suffix tree.

## Applications

The suffix array can be used for various string operations, such as pattern matching, pattern search, and pattern matching.

## Pattern Matching

The suffix array can be used for pattern matching. The idea is to use the binary search to find the first and last occurrence of the pattern in the suffix array. The time complexity of this operation is O(log n + m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the pattern.

## Pattern Search

The suffix array can be used for pattern search. The idea is to use the suffix array to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text. The time complexity of this operation is O(log n + m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the pattern.
