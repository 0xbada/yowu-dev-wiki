# How to Build a Secure Application with OAuth and OpenID Connect

The modern web is all about accessing data and services from a variety of different sources. However, this can pose a security risk if not done properly. In this article, we'll show you how to build a secure application with OAuth and OpenID Connect.

## What is OAuth?

OAuth is an open standard for authorization that allows you to securely access data and services from a variety of different sources. It works by allowing you to specify which data and services you want to access, and then authorizing your access to those resources.

## What is OpenID Connect?

OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol that builds on top of OAuth. It allows you to authenticate users with a variety of different providers, such as Facebook or Google.

## How to Use OAuth and OpenID Connect

In order to use OAuth and OpenID Connect, you'll need to register your application with a provider. Each provider has their own process for doing this, so we won't go into detail here.

Once you've registered your application, you'll need to specify which data and services you want to access. This is done by creating a "scope" for your application. A scope is simply a list of permissions that you're requesting from the provider.

For example, if you're building a to-do list application, you might request the following scopes:

- Read and write access to the user's to-do list
- Read access to the user's profile information

Once you've created your scope, you'll need to send the user to the provider's authorization endpoint. This is a URL that the provider will use to authorize your access to the user's data.

The authorization endpoint will ask the user to login and then ask them to grant your application access to the data and services that you've specified in your scope.

Once the user has granted your application access, the provider will redirect the user back to your application with an authorization code. This code can then be exchanged for an access token, which can be used to access the user's data.

## How to Secure Your Application

Once you have an access token, you'll need to take some precautions to ensure that it is used securely.

First, you should never store the access token in plain text. Instead, you should store it in an encrypted format.

Second, you should only ever send the access token over an encrypted connection, such as HTTPS.

Third, you should ensure that the access token is only ever used for the data and services that it was intended for. For example, if your application only needs read access to the user's to-do list, then the access token should only be used for that purpose.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've shown you how to build a secure application with OAuth and OpenID Connect. By taking the precautions outlined in this article, you can ensure that your application is secure and that your user's data is protected.
