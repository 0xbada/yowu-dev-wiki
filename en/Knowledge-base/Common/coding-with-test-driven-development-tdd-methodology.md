# Coding with Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which tests are written before code is written. The purpose of TDD is to ensure that the code meets the requirements specified by the tests.

TDD is an iterative process that consists of the following steps:

1. Write a test that fails.
2. Write code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code to meet the requirements of the test.
4. Repeat the steps until all the requirements are met.

The main advantage of TDD is that it helps to prevent bugs from being introduced into the code. This is because the code is written to meet the requirements of the tests.

In order to write tests that are effective, it is important to have a good understanding of the requirements. The tests should be written in such a way that they cover all the requirements.

It is also important to have a good understanding of the code that is being tested. The tests should be written in such a way that they exercise all the code paths.

It is also important to have a good understanding of the testing framework that is being used. The tests should be written in such a way that they are easy to run and easy to understand.

TDD is a disciplined approach to coding that can help to improve the quality of the code. However, it is important to remember that TDD is not a silver bullet. It is just one tool that can be used to help improve the quality of the code.
