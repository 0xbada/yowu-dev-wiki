# How to Secure Your Website with HTTPS and SSL Certificates

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text.

HTTP secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS), is more commonly known as HTTPS, and is used to protect the confidentiality of data between the user's web browser and the website. TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over the Internet.

When a web browser attempts to access a website that is secured with HTTPS, the browser and the web server establish a secure connection using TLS. TLS uses a combination of public-key and symmetric-key cryptography to encrypt data being transmitted over the connection.

A website that is secured with HTTPS is identified by a green padlock in the browser's address bar.

## What is SSL?

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser. An SSL certificate is required to create an SSL connection.

SSL is commonly used to secure credit card transactions, data transfer, and logins. It is also used to protect email, instant messaging, and Voice over IP (VoIP) conversations.

 SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted third-parties that verify the identity of the website and the website's owner.

## How Does SSL Work?

When a web browser attempts to access a website that is secured with SSL, the browser and the web server establish an SSL connection using the TLS protocol.

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over the Internet. TLS uses a combination of public-key and symmetric-key cryptography to encrypt data being transmitted over the connection.

The public-key is used to encrypt the data and the symmetric-key is used to decrypt the data.

## What is an SSL Certificate?

An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that is used to create an SSL connection.

SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted third-parties that verify the identity of the website and the website's owner.

A website that is secured with SSL is identified by a green padlock in the browser's address bar.

## How to Secure Your Website with HTTPS

To secure your website with HTTPS, you will need to obtain an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority.

 Once you have obtained an SSL certificate, you will need to install it on your web server and configure your website to use HTTPS.

## Obtaining an SSL Certificate

There are a few different types of SSL certificates that you can choose from, depending on your needs. The most common type of SSL certificate is a Domain Validated (DV) certificate.

A DV SSL certificate is the simplest and most common type of SSL certificate. DV SSL certificates are typically issued within a few minutes and do not require any paperwork.

If you need an SSL certificate for your website, you can generate a DV SSL certificate for free using Let's Encrypt.

## Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority.

Let's Encrypt makes it easy to obtain and install free SSL/TLS certificates, thereby enabling encrypted HTTPS on web servers.

## Installing an SSL Certificate

Once you have obtained an SSL certificate, you will need to install it on your web server.

The process for installing an SSL certificate will vary depending on your web server software.

## Configuring Your Website to Use HTTPS

Once you have installed your SSL certificate, you will need to configure your website to use HTTPS.

The process for configuring your website to use HTTPS will vary depending on your web server software.

## Testing Your Website

Once you have configured your website to use HTTPS, you should test your website to ensure that it is working correctly.

You can test your website for free using the SSL Labs Server Test.
