  Accessibility is important for everyone. It is essential for people with disabilities, and benefits everyone else as well, including people using mobile devices, people with temporary impairments such as broken arms, and people with changing abilities due to aging.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are international standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). They explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG 2.0 is the most recent version, published in December 2008.

 WCAG 2.0 has four principles:

*   Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
*   Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
*   Understandable: Information and the operation of user interface components must be understandable.
*   Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. They are organized by four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

There are three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. A is the minimum level of conformance required for WCAG 2.0. AA is the recommended level of conformance for WCAG 2.0. AAA is the highest level of conformance possible.

## Why is accessibility important?

Accessibility is important for everyone. It is essential for people with disabilities, and benefits everyone else as well, including people using mobile devices, people with temporary impairments such as broken arms, and people with changing abilities due to aging.

Some people with disabilities may use assistive technologies to access web content. Assistive technologies include screen readers, screen magnifiers, and alternative input devices.

People with disabilities often have a hard time using the web. They may not be able to see, hear, move, or understand some web content. Web content that is not accessible can exclude people with disabilities.

WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. They are organized by four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

There are three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. A is the minimum level of conformance required for WCAG 2.0. AA is the recommended level of conformance for WCAG 2.0. AAA is the highest level of conformance possible.
