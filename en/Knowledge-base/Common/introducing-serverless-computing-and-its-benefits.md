# Introduction

Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically allocates machine resources to run a customer's application code. 

In a serverless model, developers can write code and upload it to the cloud provider, which will execute the code on demand in a scalable way. There is no need to provision or manage any servers.

The term "serverless" is used in two different ways. First, it can refer to the fact that there are no servers to manage. Second, it can refer to the fact that the code is not running on a traditional server, but rather in a serverless environment.

In this article, we will focus on the latter meaning of serverless. We will discuss what a serverless environment is, and how it can benefit developers.

# What is a Serverless Environment?

A serverless environment is one in which the code is not running on a traditional server, but rather in a cloud-based environment. The cloud provider is responsible for executing the code and scaling the application as needed.

There are several benefits to this model. First, it can save developers time and money. Second, it can make applications more scalable and reliable. And third, it can allow developers to focus on their code, rather than on server management.

# Benefits of Serverless Computing

There are several benefits to using serverless computing. First, it can save developers time and money. Second, it can make applications more scalable and reliable. And third, it can allow developers to focus on their code, rather than on server management.

1. Save time and money

One of the biggest benefits of serverless computing is that it can save developers time and money. In a traditional server-based model, developers have to provision and manage servers. This can be a time-consuming and expensive process.

In a serverless model, the cloud provider takes care of all of the server management. This can free up developers to focus on their code, rather than on server management.

2. Make applications more scalable and reliable

Another benefit of serverless computing is that it can make applications more scalable and reliable. In a traditional server-based model, it can be difficult to scale an application. This is because each server can only handle a certain amount of traffic.

In a serverless model, the cloud provider can automatically scale the application as needed. This can make it easier to handle sudden spikes in traffic, and can make the application more reliable.

3. Allow developers to focus on their code

In a traditional server-based model, developers have to spend time on server management. This can take away from time that could be spent on developing the code.

In a serverless model, the cloud provider takes care of all of the server management. This can allow developers to focus on their code, rather than on server management.

# Conclusion

Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically allocates machine resources to run a customer's application code.
