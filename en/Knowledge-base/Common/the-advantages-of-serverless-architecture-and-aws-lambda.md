# Introduction

The serverless architecture is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and the customer pays per use. It's a way of building and running applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. 

In the serverless model, developers can write code that runs in the cloud without having to provision or manage any servers. They can simply upload their code and the cloud provider will execute it on demand. 

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to build applications that respond quickly to new information. Lambda can also process records in Amazon DynamoDB streams and invoke AWS Lambda functions.

# Advantages of Serverless Architecture

The main advantages of the serverless architecture are:

- No server management: The cloud provider takes care of all the infrastructure, making it much easier for developers to focus on code.

- Reduced costs: Customers only pay for the compute resources they use, making serverless a very cost-effective way to run applications and services.

- Increased flexibility: Since there is no need to provision or manage servers, developers can easily scale their applications up or down as needed.

- Improved efficiency: Developers can focus on writing code and let the cloud provider handle all the undifferentiated heavy lifting required to run the code.

# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda handles all the undifferentiated heavy lifting required to run your code.

Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger. Lambda runs code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning, and automatic scaling.

Lambda is a perfect fit for event-driven applications and can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

- Image processing: Resize images on the fly for mobile devices.

- File conversion: Convert video files from one format to another.

- Log processing: Process and analyze log files from Amazon S3.

- Data processing: Process streaming data from Amazon Kinesis.

- IoT backends: Process and route IoT data from Amazon IoT devices.
