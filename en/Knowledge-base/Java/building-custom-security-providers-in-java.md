# Building Custom Security Providers in Java

The Java platform provides a way to plug in security providers that implement security algorithms. For example, the SunJCE provider supplies implementations of various algorithms such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), Key Agreement, and Secret-Key Factory algorithms.

In this article, we'll learn how to write our own security provider in Java and how to integrate it into the Java security architecture.

## What is a Security Provider?

A security provider is a piece of software that supplies implementations of security algorithms. The Java platform comes with a default security provider, called the "SUN" provider (or the "SunJCE" provider), which supplies implementations of various algorithms such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), Key Agreement, and Secret-Key Factory algorithms.

However, the SUN provider is not the only security provider available. Other providers, such as the Bouncy Castle provider, also supply implementations of various security algorithms.

## The Provider Architecture

The Java security architecture is designed to allow applications to plug in different security providers as needed. This architecture is based on the following concepts:

- A **service** is a well-defined set of algorithms (or other functionality) that a provider may implement.
- A **provider** is a package or library that supplies one or more implementations of a service.
- A **service type** is a Java interface or class that specifies a particular type of service.

For example, the KeyFactory service is responsible for converting keys (of type Key) into key specifications (of type KeySpec), and vice versa. The SUN provider supplies an implementation of this service, and the Bouncy Castle provider also supplies an implementation of this service.

The Java security architecture defines a number of standard service types, such as KeyFactory, KeyPairGenerator, and MessageDigest. A provider that supplies an implementation of one of these standard services is said to "implement" that service.

## Registering a Provider

Before a provider can be used, it must be registered with the Java security architecture. This can be done programmatically, by calling the Security.addProvider() method, or statically, by adding the provider to the java.security file.

Adding a provider statically is the preferred approach, as it does not require modification of application code.

The following is an example of adding a provider statically:

```
security.provider.1=com.example.MyProvider
```

In this example, MyProvider is the name of the provider class.

## The Provider Class

Every provider must have a provider class. The provider class is a concrete subclass of the Provider class. The provider class must have a public constructor that takes a single String argument, which is the provider name.

The provider class must also override the getName() and getInfo() methods inherited from the Provider class.

The following is a simple example of a provider class:

```java
package com.example;

import java.security.Provider;

public class MyProvider extends Provider {

    public MyProvider() {
        super("MyProvider", 1.0, "MyProvider");
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "MyProvider";
    }

    @Override
    public String getInfo() {
        return "MyProvider 1.0";
    }
}
```

In this example, the provider name is "MyProvider" and the provider version is "1.0".

## Implementing a Service

Once a provider class has been written, the next step is to implement one or more services. As mentioned earlier, a service is a well-defined set of algorithms (or other functionality) that a provider may implement.

For example, the SUN provider supplies implementations of various services such as the KeyFactory service, the KeyPairGenerator service, and the MessageDigest service.

To implement a service, a provider must supply a concrete subclass of the Service class. This subclass must have a public constructor that takes the following arguments:

- A Provider object.
- A String object, which is the type of the service.
- A String object, which is the algorithm name.
- A String object, which is the class name of the implementation.

The following is a simple example of a Service subclass:

```java
package com.example;

import java.security.Provider;
import java.security.Service;

public class MyService extends Service {

    public MyService(Provider provider, String type, String algorithm, String className) {
        super(provider, type, algorithm, className, null, null);
    }
}
```

In this example, the type of the service is "KeyFactory", the algorithm name is "DSA", and the class name of the implementation is "com.example.MyKeyFactory".

## The KeyFactory Service

The KeyFactory service is responsible for converting keys (of type Key) into key specifications (of type KeySpec), and vice versa.

A KeyFactory service must implement the following methods:

- generatePublic(KeySpec keySpec)
- generatePrivate(KeySpec keySpec)
- getKeySpec(Key key, Class keySpec)
- translateKey(Key key)

In addition, a KeyFactory service may optionally implement the following methods:

- generateSecretKey(KeySpec keySpec)
- getKeySpec(Key key, Class keySpec)

The KeyFactory service is typically used by applications to convert between different key formats. For example, an application may have a key in the form of an X.509 certificate and need to convert it into a format that can be used by the Signature service.

The following is a simple example of a KeyFactory service:

```java
package com.example;

import java.security.Key;
import java.security.KeyFactory;
import java.security.KeySpec;
import java.security.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec;

public class MyKeyFactory extends KeyFactory {

    public MyKeyFactory() {
        super("MyKeyFactory");
    }

    @Override
    public Key generatePublic(KeySpec keySpec) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Key generatePrivate(KeySpec keySpec) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public KeySpec getKeySpec(Key key, Class keySpec) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Key translateKey(Key key) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this example, the KeyFactory service is named "MyKeyFactory" and it implements the generatePublic(), generatePrivate(), getKeySpec(), and translateKey() methods.

## The Signature Service

The Signature service is responsible for creating and verifying digital signatures.

A Signature service must implement the following methods:

- initSign(PrivateKey privateKey)
- initVerify(PublicKey publicKey)
- sign()
- verify(byte[] signature)

In addition, a Signature service may optionally implement the following methods:

- setParameter(String parameterName, Object parameterValue)
- getParameter(String parameterName)

The Signature service is typically used by applications to create and verify digital signatures. For example, an application may use the Signature service to sign a document before sending it over the network.

The following is a simple example of a Signature service:

```java
package com.example;

import java.security.Key;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.security.Signature;

public class MySignature extends Signature {

    public MySignature() {
        super("MySignature");
    }

    @Override
    public void initSign(PrivateKey privateKey) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
    }

    @Override
    public void initVerify(PublicKey publicKey) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
    }

    @Override
    public void sign() {
        // TODO: Implement this method
    }

    @Override
    public boolean verify(byte[] signature) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this example, the Signature service is named "MySignature" and it implements the initSign(), initVerify(), sign(), and verify() methods.

## The MessageDigest Service

The MessageDigest service is responsible for creating message digests. A message digest is a cryptographic hash function that is used to create a digital fingerprint of a piece of data.

A MessageDigest service must implement the following methods:

- update(byte[] data)
- update(byte[] data, int off, int len)
- digest()
- digest(byte[] data)
- isEqual(byte[] digestA, byte[] digestB)

In addition, a MessageDigest service may optionally implement the following methods:

- reset()
- clone()

The MessageDigest service is typically used by applications to create message digests. For example, an application may use the MessageDigest service to create a message digest of a document before sending it over the network.

The following is a simple example of a MessageDigest service:

```java
package com.example;

import java.security.MessageDigest;

public class MyMessageDigest extends MessageDigest {

    public MyMessageDigest() {
        super("MyMessageDigest");
    }

    @Override
    public void update(byte[] data) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
    }

    @Override
    public void update(byte[] data, int off, int len) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
    }

    @Override
    public byte[] digest() {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public int digest(byte[] data, int off, int len) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isEqual(byte[] digestA, byte[] digestB) {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public void reset() {
        // TODO: Implement this method
    }

    @Override
    public Object clone() {
        // TODO: Implement this method
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this example, the MessageDigest service is named "MyMessageDigest" and it implements the update(), update(), digest(), digest(), isEqual(), reset(), and clone() methods.
