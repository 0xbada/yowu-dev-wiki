# Java's java.util.concurrent Package for Parallel Programming

The `java.util.concurrent` package provides a set of classes and interfaces that support multithreaded programming. This package enables developers to easily write programs that take advantage of multiple processors.

The `java.util.concurrent` package contains the following items:

* Executors
* Futures
* Thread Pools
* Locks
* Atomic Variables
* Concurrent Collections
* Synchronizers

In this article, we will focus on how to use the `java.util.concurrent` package to write parallel programs.

## Executors

An `Executor` is an object that executes submitted `Runnable` tasks. The `Executor` interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including queuing, scheduling, and execution.

There are a number of built-in `Executor` implementations in the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`. We can also create our own `Executor` implementation.

In the following example, we create a `Runnable` task and submit it to an `Executor` for execution:

```java
Runnable task = () -> {
    // Do something
};

Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.execute(task);
```

## Futures

A `Future` represents the result of an asynchronous computation. We can use a `Future` to check if the computation is complete, and to retrieve the result of the computation.

In the following example, we use a `Future` to check if a task has finished and to retrieve the result:

```java
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);

if (future.isDone()) {
    int result = future.get();
}
```

## Thread Pools

A `ThreadPool` is a collection of `Threads` that can be used to execute tasks. A `ThreadPool` manages the `Threads` in the pool, and provides mechanisms to reuse `Threads` when they are available.

In the following example, we create a `ThreadPool` with four `Threads`:

```java
ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
```

We can submit `Runnable` tasks to the `ThreadPool` for execution:

```java
threadPool.submit(task);
```

When we are finished with the `ThreadPool`, we can shut it down:

```java
threadPool.shutdown();
```

## Locks

A `Lock` is a mechanism for controlling access to a shared resource. Locks can be used to implement critical sections, which are sections of code that must be executed atomically.

In the following example, we use a `Lock` to control access to a shared resource:

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

lock.lock();
try {
    // Access the shared resource
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

## Atomic Variables

An `AtomicVariable` is a variable that can be updated atomically. `AtomicVariable`s are used to implement critical sections.

In the following example, we use an `AtomicVariable` to control access to a shared resource:

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();

int value = counter.incrementAndGet();
```

## Concurrent Collections

The `java.util.concurrent` package contains a number of concurrent collections, which are collections that can be safely used by multiple threads.

In the following example, we use a `ConcurrentHashMap` to store data in a thread-safe way:

```java
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

map.put("foo", 42);
map.get("foo");
```

## Synchronizers

A `Synchronizer` is an object that coordinates the actions of multiple threads. The `java.util.concurrent` package contains a number of synchronizers, such as `Semaphore` and `CountDownLatch`.

In the following example, we use a `CountDownLatch` to wait for a task to finish:

```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

executor.submit(() -> {
    try {
        // Do something
        latch.countDown();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle the exception
    }
});

latch.await();
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we have looked at how to use the `java.util.concurrent` package to write parallel programs. We have seen how to use `Executors`, `Futures`, `ThreadPools`, `Locks`, `AtomicVariables`, `ConcurrentCollections`, and `Synchronizers`.
