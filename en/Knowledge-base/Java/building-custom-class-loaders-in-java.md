# Building Custom Class Loaders in Java

When developing Java applications, you may need to create your own custom class loader. This is often the case when you want to load classes from a location other than the default classpath, or when you want to modify the way classes are loaded.

In this article, we'll look at how to create a custom class loader in Java. We'll also look at some of the common use cases for custom class loaders.

## What is a Class Loader?

Before we dive into how to create a custom class loader, let's first take a step back and understand what a class loader is.

A class loader is a piece of software that is responsible for loading classes into a Java application. When a Java application starts, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads a class loader. This class loader is responsible for loading the application's classes.

The JVM comes with a default class loader, called the bootstrap class loader. This class loader is responsible for loading the core Java classes, such as `java.lang.String` and `java.util.ArrayList`.

In addition to the bootstrap class loader, the JVM comes with two other class loaders: the system class loader and the extension class loader.

The system class loader is responsible for loading the classes in the application's classpath. The classpath is a list of locations that the JVM should search for classes. By default, the classpath includes the `jre/lib/` and the `jre/class/` directories.

The extension class loader is responsible for loading the classes in the `extensions/` directory. The `extensions/` directory is where developers can place JAR files that they want to be available to all applications on the system.

## Why Would You Need a Custom Class Loader?

Now that we've reviewed what a class loader is, let's take a look at some of the reasons why you might need to create a custom class loader.

### Loading Classes From a Different Location

One common reason for creating a custom class loader is to load classes from a location other than the default classpath.

For example, let's say you have a directory on your filesystem that contains some custom classes that you want to load into your application. You could add this directory to your classpath, but then your application would only be able to load classes from that directory.

If you want your application to be able to load classes from multiple directories, you'll need to create a custom class loader. This custom class loader can search for classes in multiple directories, not just the classpath.

### Modifying the Way Classes are Loaded

Another common reason for creating a custom class loader is to modify the way classes are loaded.

For example, let's say you have a JAR file that contains some classes that you want to load into your application. However, you don't want these classes to be loaded by the system class loader. Instead, you want to use a custom class loader that will load these classes into a separate namespace.

This is just one example of how you might want to modify the way classes are loaded. There are many other possibilities.

## Creating a Custom Class Loader

Now that we've seen some of the reasons why you might need to create a custom class loader, let's take a look at how to actually create one.

Creating a custom class loader is relatively simple. You just need to create a class that extends `java.lang.ClassLoader`. This class must override the `loadClass()` method.

Here's a simple example:

```java
public class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
 
    @Override
    public Class<?> loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        // Load the class from the filesystem
        // ...
        // Return the loaded class
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this example, we've created a custom class loader that loads classes from the filesystem. This class loader doesn't actually load any classes, but it provides a skeleton that you can use to create your own custom class loader.

## Using a Custom Class Loader

Once you've created a custom class loader, you need to tell the JVM to use it. You can do this by setting the `java.class.path` system property.

For example, let's say you have a custom class loader that loads classes from the `/path/to/classes` directory. You can tell the JVM to use this class loader by setting the `java.class.path` system property to `/path/to/classes`.

You can set the `java.class.path` system property on the command line when you start your Java application:

```
java -Djava.class.path=/path/to/classes MyApplication
```

Alternatively, you can set the system property programmatically:

```java
System.setProperty("java.class.path", "/path/to/classes");
```

Once you've set the `java.class.path` system property, the JVM will use your custom class loader to load classes.
