# Building Custom Executors in Java

Developers often need to create custom executors to run tasks in parallel. In this article, we'll explore how to do this in Java.

## Creating a Thread Pool

The first step in creating a custom executor is to create a thread pool. This can be done using the ```Executors``` class:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
```

This will create a thread pool with 10 threads. You can also use the ```Executors``` class to create a single-threaded executor:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

## Executing Tasks

Once you have an executor, you can submit tasks to it for execution. For example, let's say you have a ```Runnable``` task:

```java
Runnable task = () -> {
    // task logic here
};
```

You can submit this task to the executor for execution using the ```submit()``` method:

```java
executor.submit(task);
```

If you have a ```Callable``` task, you can submit it using the ```submit()``` method as well:

```java
Callable<T> task = () -> {
    // task logic here
    return result;
};
```

## Terminating a Thread Pool

Once you are finished executing tasks, you will need to shutdown the thread pool. This can be done using the ```shutdown()``` method:

```java
executor.shutdown();
```

If you want to shutdown the thread pool immediately, you can use the ```shutdownNow()``` method:

```java
executor.shutdownNow();
```
