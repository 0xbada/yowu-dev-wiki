# Java's Dynamic Proxies for Dynamic Object Oriented Programming

Java's dynamic proxies allow for a type-safe, object-oriented way to create dynamic code. In this article, we'll explore how to use dynamic proxies to create dynamic code and how they can be used in practical applications.

## What are Dynamic Proxies?

A dynamic proxy is a class that implements a list of interfaces specified at runtime. When a method is invoked on a dynamic proxy instance, the method invocation is forwarded to the invoke() method of the Proxy class, which dispatches the call to the appropriate method handler. 

A dynamic proxy can be used to create a "wrapper" around an object, which can be used to add functionality to the object without modifying the original code. For example, a dynamic proxy could be used to add logging to all method calls on an object, or to add security checks before allowing a method to be invoked.

## Creating a Dynamic Proxy

Creating a dynamic proxy is relatively simple. First, you need to create an instance of the Proxy class, passing in the ClassLoader for the class you want to proxy, and an array of interfaces that the proxy should implement. For example:

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = MyObject.class.getClassLoader();
Class[] interfaces = new Class[] { MyObject.class };

MyObject myObject = (MyObject) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, new MyObjectInvocationHandler(myObject));
```

In the example above, we're using the Proxy class to create a dynamic proxy for the MyObject class. The MyObject class must be loadable by the given ClassLoader, and must implement the MyObject interface. The third argument to the Proxy.newProxyInstance() method is an instance of an InvocationHandler, which is responsible for handling method calls on the proxy. 

In the example above, we've created a simple InvocationHandler that just forwards method calls to the original object. However, you could just as easily add your own logic to the InvocationHandler, such as logging method calls or adding security checks.

## Using a Dynamic Proxy

Once you've created a dynamic proxy, you can use it just like any other object. For example, if you have a dynamic proxy for the MyObject class, you can invoke methods on the proxy just like you would on the original object:

```java
myObject.doSomething();
```

## Why Use Dynamic Proxies?

Dynamic proxies are a powerful tool for creating dynamic code. They can be used to add functionality to an object without modifying the original code, which can be very useful in situations where you don't have access to the source code. 

Dynamic proxies can also be used to create "wrapper" objects that can be used to add functionality to an object without changing the interface of the object. For example, you could use a dynamic proxy to create a wrapper around an object that adds logging to all method calls on the object, without changing the interface of the object. 

## When to Use Dynamic Proxies

Dynamic proxies can be very useful in situations where you need to add functionality to an object without modifying the original code. They can also be used to create "wrapper" objects that can be used to add functionality to an object without changing the interface of the object. 

## When Not to Use Dynamic Proxies

Dynamic proxies should not be used in situations where performance is critical, as they add a layer of indirection that can impact performance. They also should not be used in situations where the underlying object needs to be passed to a native method, as the Proxy class is not natively supported by the JVM. 

## Conclusion

Dynamic proxies are a powerful tool for creating dynamic code. They can be used to add functionality to an object without modifying the original code, which can be very useful in situations where you don't have access to the source code. Dynamic proxies can also be used to create "wrapper" objects that can be used to add functionality to an object without changing the interface of the object.
