# A Guide to Java's java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition for Thread Signaling

Threads often need to communicate with each other. For example, one thread may need to tell other threads that a task is done, or that a shared resource is available.

Java has a built-in mechanism for thread communication, called the `java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition` class. In this article, we'll take a look at how to use `Condition` to communicate between threads.

## What is Condition?

Condition is a Java class that allows threads to wait for or signal other threads. It's part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package, which also contains the `Lock` class.

Condition works with Lock to provide a more flexible way of controlling when threads can run. With Lock, a thread can only run when it holds the lock. With Condition, a thread can run only when another thread has signaled it.

## Using Condition

Condition works with Lock to provide a more flexible way of controlling when threads can run. With Lock, a thread can only run when it holds the lock. With Condition, a thread can run only when another thread has signaled it.

Here's a simple example of how Condition can be used. Suppose we have a shared resource that can be in one of two states: empty or full. We have two threads: one that produces the resource, and one that consumes it.

We want to make sure that the consumer thread only tries to consume the resource when it's in the "full" state, and that the producer thread only tries to produce the resource when it's in the "empty" state. To do this, we can use a Lock and a Condition:


```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Resource {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition isEmpty = lock.newCondition();
    private final Condition isFull = lock.newCondition();

    private boolean empty = true;

    public void produce() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (!empty) {
                isEmpty.await();
            }
            // produce resource
            empty = false;
            isFull.signalAll();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (empty) {
                isFull.await();
            }
            // consume resource
            empty = true;
            isEmpty.signalAll();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `produce()` method first checks if the resource is empty. If it's not, it waits until it is empty (by calling `isEmpty.await()`). Once the resource is empty, it produces the resource and signals any waiting threads (by calling `isFull.signalAll()`).

Similarly, the `consume()` method first checks if the resource is full. If it's not, it waits until it is full (by calling `isFull.await()`). Once the resource is full, it consumes the resource and signals any waiting threads (by calling `isEmpty.signalAll()`).

## Other Methods

Condition also provides a `signal()` method, which wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the condition. If multiple threads are waiting, one of them will be chosen at random to wake up.

There is also a `awaitUninterruptibly()` method, which is similar to `await()` except that it doesn't throw InterruptedException if the thread is interrupted.

## Tips for Using Condition

Here are a few tips for using Condition:

- Always call `await()` or `signal()` within a loop. This is because `await()` can be interrupted (by a call to `interrupt()`), and `signal()` can be lost (if multiple threads are waiting, only one of them will be woken up).

- Be careful not to call `await()` or `signal()` outside of a lock. If you do, another thread could acquire the lock in between the time you check the condition and the time you call `await()` or `signal()`. This could cause your program to freeze.

- When using multiple conditions, be careful not to use the same lock for all of them. This could cause a deadlock.
