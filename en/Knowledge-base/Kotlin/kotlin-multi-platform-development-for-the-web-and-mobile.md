Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript, and Native. It's a great language for LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) with excellent support for complex functional programming. Kotlin Multi-platform Development is an efficient way to write portable code that can run on multiple platforms, including the Web, Mobile, Desktop, and more.

In this article, we'll take a look at how to get started with Kotlin Multi-platform Development, and some of the benefits that it offers. We'll also explore some of the best practices for developing portable code.

## What is Kotlin Multi-platform Development?

Kotlin Multi-platform Development is a way to write code that can run on multiple platforms. This includes the ability to write code that can run on the JVM, Android, iOS, JavaScript, Native, and more. 

In order to write code that is portable, you need to use the Kotlin Multi-platform Mobile library. This library provides a number of helpful functions and classes that make it easy to write code that can run on multiple platforms. 

One of the benefits of using the Kotlin Multi-platform Mobile library is that it helps to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write. This is because the library provides a number of helper functions that can be used to simplify the code that you write. 

Another benefit of using the Kotlin Multi-platform Mobile library is that it allows you to write code that is type-safe. This means that you can avoid a number of potential errors that can occur when you are writing code that is not type-safe. 

## Getting Started with Kotlin Multi-platform Development

In order to get started with Kotlin Multi-platform Development, you need to use the Kotlin Multi-platform Mobile library. This library provides a number of helper functions and classes that make it easy to write code that can run on multiple platforms. 

In order to use the Kotlin Multi-platform Mobile library, you need to add the following dependency to your project:

```groovy
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-multiplatform-mobile"
```

Once you have added the dependency, you can start using the Kotlin Multi-platform Mobile library in your project. 

## Benefits of Kotlin Multi-platform Development

There are a number of benefits that you can get from Kotlin Multi-platform Development. These benefits include the ability to write portable code, the ability to write type-safe code, and the ability to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write.
