# Kotlin and Flask: Building a Simple Web Application

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the JVM and can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. It is an open-source, pragmatic language that combines features of both functional and object-oriented programming.

Flask is a Python web framework built with a small core and easy-to-extend philosophy. Flask is a popular choice for building microservices due to its lightweight nature.

In this article, we'll see how to use Kotlin and Flask to build a simple web application. We'll start by setting up our development environment and then we'll create a Kotlin class and a Flask route to display a simple message.

## Setting up the Development Environment

Before we can start coding, we need to set up our development environment. We'll need to install the Kotlin compiler and the Flask web framework.

### Installing the Kotlin Compiler

You can install the Kotlin compiler from the [official Kotlin website](https://kotlinlang.org/). There are instructions for installing Kotlin on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Installing Flask

Flask can be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager.

```
$ pip install flask
```

## Hello, Kotlin

Now that we have our development environment set up, let's write some Kotlin code. We'll start by creating a Kotlin file named `Hello.kt`.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

We can compile this Kotlin code to JavaScript using the `kotlinc` compiler.

```
$ kotlinc Hello.kt -output hello.js
```

We can also compile it to native code using the `kotlinc-native` compiler.

```
$ kotlinc-native Hello.kt -o hello
```

## Hello, Flask

Now that we have our Kotlin file, let's write a Flask route to display a simple message. We'll create a file named `app.py` and import the `Flask` class.

```python
from flask import Flask
```

Next, we'll create an instance of the `Flask` class. We need to pass in a name for our application.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

Now, we can create a route. A route is a function that is decorated with the `@app.route` decorator. The `@app.route` decorator takes a path as an argument. This is the path that will be associated with the function.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'
```

Finally, we need to tell Flask to run our application. We do this by calling the `run` method.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

We can run our Flask application using the `flask` command.

```
$ flask run
 * Serving Flask app "app"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

We can now access our application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've seen how to use Kotlin and Flask to build a simple web application. We've started by setting up our development environment and then we've created a Kotlin file and a Flask route to display a simple message.
