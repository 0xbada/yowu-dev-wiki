## Introduction

Authorization is the process of determining whether a user is allowed to perform an action or access a resource. In most applications, authorization is enforced by checking the user's roles and permissions.

In this article, we'll take a look at some advanced topics around Kotlin and authorization. We'll start by looking at how to define roles and permissions. Then, we'll see how to work with the authorization context. Finally, we'll look at how to enforce authorization.

## Defining Roles and Permissions

One of the first steps in setting up authorization is to define the roles and permissions that users can have. There are many ways to do this, but one approach is to use an enumeration:

```kotlin
enum class Role {
    USER,
    ADMIN
}

enum class Permission {
    READ,
    WRITE,
    DELETE
}
```

In this example, we've defined two roles: `USER` and `ADMIN`. We've also defined three permissions: `READ`, `WRITE`, and `DELETE`.

Once you've defined your roles and permissions, you need to decide how to assign them to users. One approach is to use a map:

```kotlin
val roles: Map<String, Set<Role>> = mapOf(
    "alice" to setOf(Role.USER),
    "bob" to setOf(Role.USER, Role.ADMIN)
)

val permissions: Map<Role, Set<Permission>> = mapOf(
    Role.USER to setOf(Permission.READ),
    Role.ADMIN to setOf(Permission.READ, Permission.WRITE, Permission.DELETE)
)
```

In this example, we've defined two maps: `roles` and `permissions`. The `roles` map maps user names to sets of roles. The `permissions` map maps roles to sets of permissions.

## Working with the Authorization Context

In most applications, the authorization context is a thread-local variable. This means that each thread has its own authorization context.

The authorization context typically contains information about the user that is currently logged in. In Kotlin, this can be represented as a data class:

```kotlin
data class AuthorizationContext(
    val user: String,
    val roles: Set<Role>
)
```

In this example, the authorization context contains a `user` property and a `roles` property. The `user` property contains the name of the user that is currently logged in. The `roles` property contains the set of roles that the user has.

The authorization context can be accessed using the `getContext()` function:

```kotlin
val context: AuthorizationContext? = getContext()
```

The `getContext()` function returns an `AuthorizationContext?` (i.e. a nullable `AuthorizationContext`). This means that the context may not be available.

If the context is available, you can use the `withContext()` function to run a block of code with a specific context:

```kotlin
withContext(context) {
    // Code that needs the context goes here
}
```

The `withContext()` function takes an `AuthorizationContext` and a block of code. It runs the block of code with the given context.

## Enforcing Authorization

Now that we've seen how to set up roles and permissions, and how to work with the authorization context, let's take a look at how to enforce authorization.

The easiest way to enforce authorization is to use the `require()` function:

```kotlin
require(context != null) { "No authorization context available." }

require(context.user == "alice") { "Unauthorized user." }

require(context.roles.contains(Role.USER)) { "Unauthorized role." }

require(permissions[Role.USER]!!.contains(Permission.READ)) { "Unauthorized permission." }
```

In this example, we're using the `require()` function to check the user's roles and permissions. If the user doesn't have the `READ` permission, then an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

Another way to enforce authorization is to use the `check()` function:

```kotlin
check(context != null) { "No authorization context available." }

check(context.user == "alice") { "Unauthorized user." }

check(context.roles.contains(Role.USER)) { "Unauthorized role." }

check(permissions[Role.USER]!!.contains(Permission.READ)) { "Unauthorized permission." }
```

In this example, we're using the `check()` function to check the user's roles and permissions. If the user doesn't have the `READ` permission, then a `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've looked at some advanced topics and best practices around Kotlin and authorization. We've seen how to define roles and permissions, how to work with the authorization context, and how to enforce authorization.

Authorization is a critical part of any application. By following the tips and tricks in this article, you can be sure that your application is secure.
