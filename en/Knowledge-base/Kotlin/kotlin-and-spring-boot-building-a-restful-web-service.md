  Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and can be used to build applications in a wide range of domains. Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

In this article, we'll see how to use Kotlin and Spring Boot to build a simple RESTful web service. We'll start by creating a Kotlin project using the Spring Initializr. Then, we'll add a few dependencies to our build file. Next, we'll write a simple controller to handle HTTP requests. Finally, we'll run our application and test our web service.

Creating a Kotlin Project

We'll start by creating a Kotlin project using the Spring Initializr. Go to the Spring Initializr website and fill in the form to create a new project. Make sure to select Kotlin as the language, and select the Web and Lombok dependencies. Lombok is a library that can be used to reduce boilerplate code.

Once you've filled in the form, click Generate Project to download a zip file containing the project. Extract the zip file and open the project in your favorite IDE.

Adding Dependencies

Next, we'll add a few dependencies to our build file. First, we'll need the Kotlin standard library. Add the following dependency to the dependencies section of your build.gradle file:

```kotlin
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8")
```

Next, we'll add the Spring Boot Web starter. This starter will give us everything we need to build a web application with Spring Boot. Add the following dependency to the dependencies section of your build.gradle file:

```kotlin
implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
```

Finally, we'll add the Lombok library. This library will help us reduce boilerplate code. Add the following dependency to the dependencies section of your build.gradle file:

```kotlin
implementation("org.projectlombok:lombok")
```

Writing a Controller

Next, we'll write a simple controller to handle HTTP requests. We'll start by creating a Kotlin file called HelloController.kt in the src/main/kotlin/com/example/helloworld directory.

In this file, we'll define a controller class called HelloController. This class will have a single method called hello(). This method will take an HTTP request and return a string. Add the following code to the HelloController.kt file:

```kotlin
package com.example.helloworld

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController

@RestController
class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    fun hello(): String {
        return "Hello, World!"
    }

}
```

In this code, we've annotated our HelloController class with the @RestController annotation. This annotation tells Spring that this class is a controller. We've also annotated our hello() method with the @GetMapping annotation. This annotation maps the hello() method to the /hello URL.

Running the Application

Now that we've written our controller, we're ready to run our application. We can do this by running the following command:

```kotlin
./gradlew bootRun
```

This command will start a web server on port 8080. We can access our web service by going to http://localhost:8080/hello in our web browser. We should see the following output:

Hello, World!

Testing the Web Service

We can also test our web service using the curl command. Run the following command to send a GET request to our web service:

```kotlin
curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello
```

This command should return the following output:

Hello, World!
