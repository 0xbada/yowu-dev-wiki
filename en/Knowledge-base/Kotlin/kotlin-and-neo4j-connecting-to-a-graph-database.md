# Kotlin and Neo4j: Connecting to a Graph Database

In this article, we'll show how to connect to a Neo4j graph database using Kotlin. We'll also take a look at some of the benefits of using a graph database and how Kotlin makes working with them easier.

## What is a graph database?

A graph database is a database that uses graph structures to store and query data. Graph databases are well-suited for data that has relationships between items, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.

Neo4j is a popular graph database that is written in Java. It has a rich set of features, including an expressive query language, schema-based constraints, and transaction support.

## Kotlin and Neo4j

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It is designed to be interoperable with Java and can be used to write applications or libraries.

Kotlin makes working with Neo4j easier in a number of ways. First, Kotlin's type system ensures that data is always valid. For example, when retrieving a node from the database, the compiler can verify that the node has the correct properties. This helps to avoid errors at runtime.

Second, Kotlin's null safety prevents null pointer exceptions. When working with Neo4j, it is often necessary to check if a node or relationship exists before working with it. Kotlin's null safety eliminates the need for these checks, making the code simpler and more concise.

Third, Kotlin's data classes make it easy to work with Neo4j's property containers. A data class is a class that is designed to hold data. Kotlin data classes have built-in support for equality, toString, and copy. This makes it easy to write code that works with Neo4j property containers.

Fourth, Kotlin's inline functions make it easy to write code that traverses graphs. In Neo4j, it is often necessary to write code that traverses the graph, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes. Kotlin's inline functions make it easy to write this code, as they allow the code to be written inline with the graph traversal.

Finally, Kotlin's Coroutines make it easy to write asynchronous code. Neo4j'sJava driver supports asynchronous programming, but it can be difficult to write code that is easy to understand. Kotlin's Coroutines make it easy to write asynchronous code that is easy to read and understand.

## Connecting to Neo4j

To connect to Neo4j from Kotlin, we need to add the Neo4j driver to our project. The Neo4j driver is available on Maven Central. To add it to our project, we need to add the following to our build.gradle file:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile "org.neo4j.driver:neo4j-java-driver:1.6.0"
}
```

We can now create a Neo4jDriver instance:

```kotlin
val driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost", AuthTokens.basic("user", "password"))
```

The driver is used to create a session:

```kotlin
val session = driver.session()
```

The session is used to run statements:

```kotlin
val result = session.run("MATCH (n) RETURN n")
```

The result can be iterated over to get the results:

```kotlin
while (result.hasNext()) {
    val record = result.next()
    println(record["n"])
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we've seen how to connect to a Neo4j graph database from Kotlin. We've also seen how Kotlin makes working with Neo4j easier.
