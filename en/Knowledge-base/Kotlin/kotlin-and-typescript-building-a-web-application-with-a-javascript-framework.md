Kotlin and TypeScript are two popular programming languages that can be used together to build web applications. In this article, we'll take a look at how to use Kotlin and TypeScript to build a web application with a JavaScript framework.

We'll start by looking at some of the benefits of using Kotlin and TypeScript together. Kotlin is a statically typed language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It's known for its safety, interoperability, and tooling support. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds Static typing and other features. It's known for its tooling support and its ability to scale.

Using Kotlin and TypeScript together gives you the benefits of both languages. You get the safety and tooling support of Kotlin, and the ability to scale of TypeScript.

Next, we'll look at how to set up a project using Kotlin and TypeScript. We'll create a simple "Hello, World!" web application.

First, we'll need to create a project directory. We can do this using the command line or an IDE. 

Next, we'll create a file called "Hello.kt" in our project directory. We'll add the following code to our file:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

We can then compile our Kotlin code using the command line:

```
kotlinc Hello.kt -d hello.js
```

This will produce a file called "hello.js" in our project directory.

Now, we can create a file called "index.html" in our project directory. We'll add the following code to our file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>

<body>
    <script src="hello.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

Finally, we can open "index.html" in a browser, and we should see our "Hello, World!" message.

Now that we've seen how to set up a project using Kotlin and TypeScript, let's look at how to use Kotlin and TypeScript with a JavaScript framework. We'll use the React JavaScript framework.

First, we'll need to install React and React-DOM. We can do this using the command line:

```
npm install react react-dom
```

Next, we'll create a file called "Hello.tsx" in our project directory. We'll add the following code to our file:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Then, we'll compile our TypeScript code using the command line:

```
tsc --jsx react Hello.tsx
```

This will produce a file called "Hello.js" in our project directory.

Finally, we'll need to update our "index.html" file to include our React code. We'll add the following code to our file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="hello.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

We can then open "index.html" in a browser, and we should see our "Hello, World!" message.
