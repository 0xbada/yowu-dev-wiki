Kotlin is a JVM based language created by JetBrains, the company behind the IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE. It is a statically typed language with type inference, meaning that the compiler can infer the type of a variable from the context. Kotlin is fully compatible with Java and can be used for server-side, client-side, and Android development.

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that is often used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) workflows. It can be used to automate the build and deployment process for Kotlin applications.

In this article, we will show you how to set up a Kotlin project with Jenkins for CI/CD. We will also provide a sample Kotlin application that can be used to demonstrate the build and deployment process.

## Setting up the Kotlin Project

The first thing we need to do is create a Kotlin project. For this example, we will use the IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin project template.

Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "Create New Project". Choose the "Kotlin/JVM" project type and click "Next".

Give the project a name and select a location for the project files. We will also need to choose a JDK for the project. Make sure to select a version of the JDK that is compatible with Kotlin.

Click "Finish" to create the project.

## Adding a Sample Kotlin Application

Now that we have a Kotlin project, we can add a sample Kotlin application. For this example, we will create a simple "Hello, World!" application.

Create a new Kotlin file in the project with the following code:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

This code will print "Hello, World!" to the console when run.

## Configuring Jenkins

Now that we have a Kotlin project set up, we can configure Jenkins for our CI/CD workflow.

There are a few things we need to do in order to set up Jenkins for our Kotlin project:

- Install the Kotlin plugin
- Configure a Jenkins job

### Installing the Kotlin Plugin

The Kotlin plugin for Jenkins adds support for building Kotlin projects. To install the plugin, go to the "Manage Plugins" page in the Jenkins web interface and select the "Available" tab. Search for "kotlin" and select the "Kotlin Plugin" from the list of results. Click "Install without restart" to install the plugin.

### Configuring a Jenkins Job

Next, we need to create a Jenkins job for our Kotlin project. To do this, go to the "New Item" page in the Jenkins web interface and select the "Freestyle project" option.

Give the job a name and select "OK".

On the job configuration page, there are a few things we need to do in order to set up the job:

- Add the Git repository for our Kotlin project
- Add a build step to compile the Kotlin code
- Add a build step to run the Kotlin application

#### Adding the Git Repository

In the "Source Code Management" section, select "Git" from the "SCM" drop-down menu. In the "Repositories" field, enter the URL of the Git repository for our Kotlin project.

#### Adding a Build Step to Compile the Kotlin Code

In the "Build" section, select "Add build step" and choose "Invoke Kotlin compiler" from the list of options.

In the "Source Files" field, enter the path to the Kotlin source files for the project. In the "Classpath" field, enter the path to the Kotlin standard library.

#### Adding a Build Step to Run the Kotlin Application

In the "Build" section, select "Add build step" and choose "Execute Kotlin script" from the list of options.

In the "Script" field, enter the following code:

```kotlin
println("Hello, World!")
```

This code will print "Hello, World!" to the console when run.

Click "Save" to save the job configuration.

## Running the Jenkins Job

Now that we have Jenkins configured, we can run the job. To do this, go to the "Build Now" page in the Jenkins web interface.

Click "Build Now" to start the build process.

Once the build is complete, you should see the "Hello, World!" message printed in the console output.

In this article, we showed you how to set up a Kotlin project with Jenkins for CI/CD. We also provided a sample Kotlin application that can be used to demonstrate the build and deployment process.
