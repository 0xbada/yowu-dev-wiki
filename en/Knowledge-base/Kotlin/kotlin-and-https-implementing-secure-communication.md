# Kotlin and HTTPS: Implementing Secure Communication

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and can be used to develop Android apps. While Kotlin's syntax is very similar to Java's, it is not compatible with Java. Kotlin is a commercial product developed by JetBrains, the company behind the popular IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE.

While Kotlin is not as widely used as Java, it is gaining popularity, especially among Android developers. In May 2019, Google announced that Kotlin is now its preferred language for Android app development. 

One of the main advantages of Kotlin is that it is a more concise language than Java. Kotlin code is often much shorter than the equivalent Java code. This can lead to less code to maintain and fewer bugs.

Kotlin is also a more expressive language than Java. It supports features such as null safety and lambdas (anonymous functions). These features can make Kotlin code more readable and easier to understand.

## Kotlin and HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol for communication between web browsers and web servers. HTTPS encrypts and decrypts communication to protect information from being intercepted or modified by third parties.

Kotlin has good support for HTTPS. In Kotlin, HTTPS connections are made using the HttpsURLConnection class. This class is part of the Java standard library, so it is available when using Kotlin without any additional dependencies.

The HttpsURLConnection class provides a number of methods for configuring HTTPS connections, such as setting the SSLContext and HostnameVerifier. The SSLContext can be used to specify the TLS protocol version and cipher suites to use. The HostnameVerifier can be used to verify the hostname of the server.

It is important to configure HTTPS connections properly to ensure that communication is secure. In particular, it is important to ensure that only strong cipher suites are used.

The following code shows how to configure a HTTPS connection in Kotlin:

```kotlin
val url = URL("https://example.com")
val connection = url.openConnection() as HttpsURLConnection
connection.sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.2")
connection.setCipherSuites(arrayOf("TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256", "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256", "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"))
connection.hostnameVerifier = HostnameVerifier { hostname, _ -> hostname == "example.com" }
```

In the above code, we first create a URL object for the HTTPS URL we want to connect to. We then open a connection to the URL using the openConnection() method. We cast the connection to a HttpsURLConnection so that we can access the HTTPS-specific methods.

We then set the SSLContext to use TLSv1.2 and specify the cipher suites to use. We also set the hostname verifier to verify that the hostname of the server is "example.com".

It is also possible to configure HTTPS connections using Java system properties. The following Java system properties can be used to configure HTTPS connections in Kotlin:

- javax.net.ssl.trustStore
- javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
- javax.net.ssl.keyStore
- javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword

## Kotlin and HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP protocol. HTTP/2 is a binary protocol that is more efficient than the previous version of the HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.1). HTTP/2 is designed to reduce latency and improve throughput.

Kotlin has good support for HTTP/2. The HttpsURLConnection class provides a number of methods for configuring HTTP/2 connections, such as setting the HTTP/2 settings and enabling push promises.

The following code shows how to configure a HTTP/2 connection in Kotlin:

```kotlin
val url = URL("https://example.com")
val connection = url.openConnection() as HttpsURLConnection
connection.protocol = "h2"
connection.setHttp2Settings(Http2Settings.builder().pushEnabled(true).build())
```

In the above code, we first create a URL object for the HTTPS URL we want to connect to. We then open a connection to the URL using the openConnection() method. We cast the connection to a HttpsURLConnection so that we can access the HTTPS-specific methods.

We then set the protocol to "h2" to indicate that we want to use HTTP/2. We also enable push promises.

It is also possible to configure HTTP/2 connections using Java system properties. The following Java system properties can be used to configure HTTP/2 connections in Kotlin:

- http.http2.enabled
- http.http2.settings.header-table-size
- http.http2.settings.initial-window-size
- http.http2.settings.max-concurrent-streams
