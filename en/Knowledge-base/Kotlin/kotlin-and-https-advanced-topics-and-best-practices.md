# Kotlin and HTTPS: Advanced Topics and Best Practices

With the release of Kotlin 1.3, the language now has full support for developing secure HTTPS connections. In this article, we'll explore some of the advanced topics and best practices around using Kotlin for HTTPS development.

## Creating a Secure HTTPS Connection

When creating a secure HTTPS connection in Kotlin, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you'll need to create a trust manager that trusts all certificates. Second, you'll need to create a key manager that uses your client certificate. Finally, you'll need to combine these managers into an SSL context.

Here's an example of how to do all of this:

```kotlin
// Create a trust manager that trusts all certificates
val trustAllCerts = arrayOf<TrustManager>(object : X509TrustManager {
    override fun checkClientTrusted(chain: Array<java.security.cert.X509Certificate>, authType: String) {}
    override fun checkServerTrusted(chain: Array<java.security.cert.X509Certificate>, authType: String) {}
    override fun getAcceptedIssuers(): Array<java.security.cert.X509Certificate> {
        return arrayOf()
    }
})

// Create a key manager that uses your client certificate
val keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm())
keyManagerFactory.init(clientCertificate, "password".toCharArray())
val keyManagers = keyManagerFactory.keyManagers

// Combine the trust manager and key manager into an SSL context
val sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS")
sslContext.init(keyManagers, trustAllCerts, null)

// Use the SSL context to create an HTTPS connection
val url = URL("https://example.com")
val connection = url.openConnection() as HttpsURLConnection
connection.sslSocketFactory = sslContext.socketFactory
connection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Kotlin")
connection.requestMethod = "GET"

// Read the response
val responseCode = connection.responseCode
val responseMessage = connection.responseMessage
println("Response Code: $responseCode")
println("Response Message: $responseMessage")

val inputStream = connection.inputStream
val responseBody = inputStream.bufferedReader().use { it.readText() }
println(responseBody)
```

## Best Practices

When using Kotlin for HTTPS development, there are a few best practices to keep in mind:

- Use a strong cipher suite. A cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms that are used to secure a connection. You can use the CipherSuite class to specify a strong cipher suite.
- Use certificate pinning. Certificate pinning is the process of associating a host with its expected X.509 certificate. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). HSTS is a security header that tells browsers to only communicate with a site using HTTPS. This helps to prevent users from accidentally connecting to a site using HTTP.

## Conclusion

Kotlin 1.3 offers full support for developing secure HTTPS connections. When using Kotlin for HTTPS development, there are a few things to keep in mind, such as using a strong cipher suite and certificate pinning. Following these best practices will help you create a secure HTTPS connection in Kotlin.
