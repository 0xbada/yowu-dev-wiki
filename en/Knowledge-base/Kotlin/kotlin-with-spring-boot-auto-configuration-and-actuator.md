# Kotlin with Spring Boot: Auto-configuration and Actuator

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the JVM and can be used to develop Android apps. Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run".

The Kotlin with Spring Boot project provides auto-configuration and Actuator support for Kotlin and Spring Boot applications.

## Auto-configuration

Auto-configuration is a feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies you have on the classpath. For example, if you include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency on the classpath, Spring Boot will automatically configure a DataSource and JPA EntityManagerFactory for you.

The Kotlin with Spring Boot project provides auto-configuration for Kotlin and Spring Boot applications. This means that, for example, if you include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency on the classpath, Kotlin with Spring Boot will automatically configure a DataSource and JPA EntityManagerFactory for you.

To use the Kotlin with Spring Boot auto-configuration, you need to add the kotlin-spring-boot-autoconfigure module to your classpath.

## Actuator

Actuator is a Spring Boot feature that allows you to monitor and manage your application. For example, the Actuator provides an HTTP endpoint that you can use to monitor the health of your application.

The Kotlin with Spring Boot project provides Actuator support for Kotlin and Spring Boot applications. This means that, for example, you can use the Actuator to monitor the health of your Kotlin and Spring Boot application.

To use the Kotlin with Spring Boot Actuator, you need to add the kotlin-spring-boot-actuator module to your classpath.

## Getting started

To get started with Kotlin and Spring Boot, you can use the Spring Initializr to generate a project with the dependencies you need. For example, to generate a project with the kotlin-spring-boot-autoconfigure and kotlin-spring-boot-actuator dependencies, you would do the following:

1. Go to https://start.spring.io/.
2. Select Kotlin from the Language drop-down.
3. Select Spring Boot 2.0.0 from the Boot Version drop-down.
4. Enter kotlin-spring-boot-example in the Artifact field.
5. Select the kotlin-spring-boot-autoconfigure and kotlin-spring-boot-actuator dependencies.
6. Click Generate Project.

You can then import the generated project into your favorite IDE and start coding!

## Conclusion

In this article, we've looked at the Kotlin with Spring Boot project, which provides auto-configuration and Actuator support for Kotlin and Spring Boot applications. We've also seen how to get started with Kotlin and Spring Boot, using the Spring Initializr to generate a project with the necessary dependencies.
