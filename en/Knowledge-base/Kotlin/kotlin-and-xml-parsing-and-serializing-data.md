# Kotlin and XML: Parsing and Serializing Data

Kotlin is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. The syntax is clean and easy to understand. Kotlin is interoperable with existing Java code, which means that it can be used to develop Android applications.

 XML is a markup language that is used to store data. It is human-readable and can be read by machines. XML is a popular choice for storing data because it is platform-independent and can be easily translated into other formats.

Kotlin and XML can be used together to parse and serialize data. In this article, we will learn how to use Kotlin to parse and serialize XML data.

## Parsing XML with Kotlin

Parsing XML with Kotlin is simple and easy. Kotlin has a built-in library for XML processing, which makes it easy to parse XML data.

First, we need to import the XML processing library:

```kotlin
import kotlin.xml.*
```

Then, we can parse XML data using the `parse` function:

```kotlin
val xmlData = """
<books>
    <book>
        <title>Kotlin in Action</title>
        <author>Dmitry Jemerov</author>
        <year>2017</year>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>Effective Java</title>
        <author>Joshua Bloch</author>
        <year>2008</year>
    </book>
</books>
""".trimIndent()

val books = xmlData.parseAsXml().books.book

for (book in books) {
    println("Title: ${book.title}")
    println("Author: ${book.author}")
    println("Year: ${book.year}")
    println()
}
```

In the example above, we first create a String containing XML data. Then, we use the `parseAsXml` function to parse the XML data. The `parseAsXml` function returns an `XmlDocument`, which contains a `books` element. The `books` element contains a `book` element for each book in the XML data.

We use a `for` loop to iterate over the `book` elements. For each `book` element, we print the title, author, and year.

## Serializing XML with Kotlin

Kotlin also makes it easy to serialize XML data. We can use the `toXmlString` function to convert XML data to a String:

```kotlin
val xmlData = books.toXmlString()
```

The `toXmlString` function takes an `XmlDocument` and converts it to a String. In the example above, we use the `toXmlString` function to convert the `books` element to a String.

## Conclusion

Kotlin and XML are a great combination for parsing and serializing data. Kotlin makes it easy to parse and serialize XML data.
