# Kotlin and REST API: Building and Consuming RESTful Services

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. Kotlin is developed by JetBrains.

The Kotlin programming language has been gaining popularity lately due to its concise syntax and interoperability with Java. In this article, we're going to see how to use Kotlin to build and consume RESTful services.

## Building a REST API with Kotlin

Let's start by building a simple REST API with Kotlin. We're going to use the [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) web framework to build our API.

First, we need to add the Ktor dependencies to our `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-core:1.3.2"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:1.3.2"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-test:1.3.2"
}
```

Next, we can create a `main.kt` file with the following code:

```kotlin
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.response.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
import io.ktor.server.engine.*
import io.ktor.server.netty.*

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    embeddedServer(Netty, 8080) {
        routing {
            get("/") {
                call.respondText("Hello, World!")
            }
        }
    }.start(wait = true)
}
```

In the code above, we're using the `routing` DSL to define a route that responds with "Hello, World!" when the `GET /` URL is accessed.

We can now run the application with the `gradle run` command and access the `http://localhost:8080` URL in our browser.

## Consuming a REST API with Kotlin

Now that we've seen how to build a REST API with Kotlin, let's see how to consume one. We're going to use the [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library for this.

First, we need to add the Retrofit dependencies to our `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0"
    implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0"
}
```

Next, we need to create a `Service` interface that defines the methods we want to use to access the API:

```kotlin
interface Service {
    @GET("/users/{id}")
    fun getUser(@Path("id") id: Int): Call<User>

    @POST("/users")
    fun createUser(@Body user: User): Call<User>

    @PUT("/users/{id}")
    fun updateUser(@Path("id") id: Int, @Body user: User): Call<User>

    @DELETE("/users/{id}")
    fun deleteUser(@Path("id") id: Int): Call<Void>
}
```

In the code above, we're using the `@GET`, `@POST`, `@PUT`, and `@DELETE` annotations to define the methods we want to use to access the `/users` URL.

We can now create a `Retrofit` instance and use it to create a `Service` instance:

```kotlin
val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://api.example.com")
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    .build()

val service = retrofit.create(Service::class.java)
```

We can now use the `service` object to access the API. For example, we can use the `getUser` method to retrieve a user with `id = 1`:

```kotlin
val user = service.getUser(1).execute().body()
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we've seen how to use Kotlin to build and consume RESTful services. Kotlin is a concise and interoperable language that is gaining popularity due to its many benefits.
