# Kotlin MVC Architecture: Building a Web Application

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a well-known software design pattern that splits the responsibilities of an application into three distinct parts: the **model**, the **view**, and the **controller**. Each of these parts has a specific role to play in the application.

The **model** is responsible for representing the data of the application and for providing methods that allow the controller to update the data. The **view** is responsible for displaying the data to the user and for providing methods that allow the controller to update the display. The **controller** is responsible for handling user input and for updating the model and the view.

In a Kotlin MVC application, the model, view, and controller are each represented by a Kotlin **class**. The model class represents the data of the application, the view class represents the display, and the controller class represents the user input.

The model, view, and controller classes are typically combined into a single file, known as the **main file**. The main file contains the code that defines the application's entry point, or main() function. The main file also contains the code that creates the model, view, and controller objects.
