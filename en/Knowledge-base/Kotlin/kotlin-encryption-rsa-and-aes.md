# Kotlin Encryption: RSA and AES

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for modern multiplatform applications. Kotlin is an official language for Android development and can be used in a variety of other applications.

Kotlin is a safe and concise language that is interoperable with Java and runs on the JVM. Kotlin also has great tooling support, making it a good choice for Android development.

In this article, we will take a look at encryption in Kotlin, specifically RSA and AES. We will look at how to generate keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and some tips on security.

## Generating Keys

In order to encrypt and decrypt data, you need a key. In RSA, there are two types of keys: public and private. The public key can be used to encrypt data, and the private key can be used to decrypt data.

In order to generate a key, you can use the `KeyPairGenerator` class.

```kotlin
val keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA")
val keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair()
val publicKey = keyPair.public
val privateKey = keyPair.private
```

## Encrypting and Decrypting Data

Once you have a key, you can use it to encrypt and decrypt data. In Kotlin, you can use the `Cipher` class to encrypt and decrypt data.

To encrypt data, you need to specify the encryption algorithm, mode, and padding. You can then initialize the `Cipher` with the `Encryption` operation mode.

```kotlin
val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding")
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey)
```

To decrypt data, you need to specify the encryption algorithm, mode, and padding. You can then initialize the `Cipher` with the `Decryption` operation mode.

```kotlin
val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding")
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey)
```

## Security

When working with encryption, it is important to consider security. One way to increase security is to use a secure random number generator to generate the keys.

```kotlin
val keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA")
keyPairGenerator.initialize(2048, SecureRandom())
val keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair()
```

Another way to increase security is to use a strong encryption algorithm, like AES. AES is a symmetric key algorithm, which means that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.

AES is a block cipher, which means that it encrypts data in blocks. AES has a block size of 128 bits.

To use AES, you need to specify the encryption algorithm, mode, and padding. You can then initialize the `Cipher` with the `Encryption` operation mode.

```kotlin
val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)
```
