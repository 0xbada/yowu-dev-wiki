# Kotlin and Bcrypt Hashing: Advanced Topics

Security is important for any web application. Hashing is one way to help make your application more secure. In this article, we'll take a look at Kotlin and Bcrypt hashing.

Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm that is designed to be difficult to crack. It is a good choice for storing passwords because it is slow, which makes it more difficult for an attacker to use brute force to crack the hash.

Kotlin is a programming language that is designed to be safe and easy to use. It is a good choice for web development because it runs on the JVM and can be used with existing Java libraries.

## What is Bcrypt?

Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm that is designed to be difficult to crack. It is a good choice for storing passwords because it is slow, which makes it more difficult for an attacker to use brute force to crack the hash.

Bcrypt uses a salt to make the hash more difficult to crack. A salt is a random string of characters that is used to make the hash more unique.

The bcrypt algorithm is:

```
bcrypt(passwd, salt) = hash(passwd, salt)
```

where:

* `passwd` is the password to hash
* `salt` is the salt
* `hash` is the bcrypt hash function

## How to use Bcrypt in Kotlin

Kotlin is a good choice for web development because it runs on the JVM and can be used with existing Java libraries.

To use bcrypt in Kotlin, we'll need to include the `bcrypt` library. We can do this using the `compile` directive in our `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
compile 'com.mindrot:jbcrypt:0.4'
```

Now that we have the library, we can create a function to hash a password:

```kotlin
fun hashPassword(password: String): String {
    val salt = BCrypt.gensalt()
    return BCrypt.hashpw(password, salt)
}
```

We can use this function to hash a password when a user signs up for our web application. We can then store the hash in our database.

When a user tries to log in, we can use the `checkpw` function to check if the password they entered is the same as the hash we have stored:

```kotlin
fun checkPassword(password: String, hash: String): Boolean {
    return BCrypt.checkpw(password, hash)
}
```

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a programming language that is designed to be safe and easy to use. It is a good choice for web development because it runs on the JVM and can be used with existing Java libraries.

Kotlin is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This can help to prevent errors in your code.

Kotlin is also null safe. This means that you cannot assign a null value to a variable unless you explicitly allow it. This can help to prevent null pointer exceptions in your code.

## How to use Kotlin for web development

Kotlin is a good choice for web development because it runs on the JVM and can be used with existing Java libraries.

To use Kotlin for web development, we'll need to include the `kotlin-stdlib` library. We can do this using the `compile` directive in our `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
compile 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.1.2'
```

Now that we have the library, we can create a Kotlin file for our web application. We'll start by creating a `main` function:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

We can run our web application using the `gradlew` command:

```
./gradlew run
```
