# Kotlin and Laravel: Building a Web Application with a PHP Framework

Developers are always looking for ways to improve their workflow and make their life easier. Kotlin is a new programming language that offers some great features and can be used for web development with the Laravel framework.

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for the JVM, Android and the browser. It is developed by JetBrains and has been gaining popularity in the past few years. Kotlin is 100% compatible with Java and can be used together with existing Java code. It is also possible to use Kotlin with other frameworks and libraries.

Laravel is a popular PHP framework for web application development. It is free and open source, and has a growing community of users. Laravel is used by many large companies, including Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

Kotlin and Laravel can be used together to build web applications. In this article, we will see how to set up a Kotlin and Laravel development environment, and how to create a simple web application using the Laravel framework.

## Setting up the development environment

To develop Kotlin applications, we need to install the Kotlin plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. The Kotlin plugin is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and Community editions, version 15 and higher.

If you don't have IntelliJ IDEA installed, you can download the Community edition from the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

Once IntelliJ IDEA is installed, we can install the Kotlin plugin from the plugins repository. To do this, go to _File_ > _Settings_ > _Plugins_ and search for the Kotlin plugin. Click _Install_ to install the plugin.

After the Kotlin plugin is installed, we need to configure the Kotlin compiler. To do this, go to _File_ > _Settings_ > _Build, Execution, Deployment_ > _Compiler_ and select _Kotlin Compiler_.

We also need to install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK). The Kotlin compiler requires JDK 8 or higher.

## Creating a Kotlin/Laravel project

We are now ready to create a Kotlin/Laravel project. To do this, we need to create a new project in IntelliJ IDEA and select the _Kotlin/JVM_ and _Laravel_ project templates.

We can now see the project structure in the _Project_ view.

The _app_ directory contains the Kotlin source files for the web application. The _resources_ directory contains the HTML templates and other resources for the web application. The _public_ directory contains the static resources, such as CSS and JavaScript files.

## Creating a web application

We are now ready to create a web application. We will start by creating a controller. In Kotlin, a controller is a class that contains the application logic.

To create a controller, we need to create a Kotlin file in the _app/Http/Controllers_ directory. We will name the file _HelloController.kt_ and add the following code to it:

```kotlin
package com.example.helloworld.controllers

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller
import org.springframework.ui.Model
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping

@Controller
class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    fun hello(model: Model): String {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!")
        return "hello"
    }

}
```

In the code above, we have created a controller with a single action. The action is annotated with the _@GetMapping_ annotation, which maps the action to the _GET_ HTTP method. The action takes a _Model_ object as a parameter and adds a message attribute to it. The message attribute will be used in the hello.html template.

The controller action returns a string, which is the name of the HTML template that should be rendered. In this case, the template is _hello.html_ and it is located in the _resources/views_ directory.

We can now add the following code to the _hello.html_ template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In the template, we have used the _{{ message }}_ expression to output the value of the message attribute.

We can now run the web application and go to the _http://localhost:8080/hello_ URL to see the greeting message.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have seen how to set up a Kotlin and Laravel development environment and how to create a simple web application using the Laravel framework.

With Kotlin and Laravel, you can create web applications with a clean and concise code. Kotlin is 100% compatible with Java, which makes it easy to use Kotlin with existing Java code and libraries. Laravel is a popular PHP framework that makes it easy to create web applications.
