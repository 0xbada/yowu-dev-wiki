# Kotlin MVC Architecture: Advanced Topics and Best Practices

In this article, we'll be discussing some advanced topics and best practices for Kotlin MVC architecture. We'll also be providing some code examples to illustrate these concepts.

## Handling Requests

One of the most important aspects of Kotlin MVC architecture is how to properly handle requests. There are two ways to do this: through filters and handlers.

### Filters

Filters are used to pre-process requests before they are handled by handlers. This is useful for tasks such as authentication and authorization, input validation, and logging.

Filters are registered in the application's ```configuration``` file:

```kotlin
// Register a filter for all requests
configuration.addFilter("MyFilter", "/*") {
    // ...
}

// Register a filter for specific requests
configuration.addFilter("MyFilter", "/my-path") {
    // ...
}
```

Once a filter is registered, it will be invoked for all matching requests. The filter has access to the request's ```Parameters```, ```Headers```, and ```Body```. It can also set ```Headers``` and ```Attributes``` on the request, which will be available to handlers.

#### Filter Example

Here's a simple example of a filter that logs all requests:

```kotlin
class RequestLoggingFilter : Filter {
    override fun invoke(call: Call, next: Next) {
        val request = call.request
        val path = request.path
        val method = request.method
        val query = request.queryString
        val headers = request.headers.entries.joinToString { "${it.key}: ${it.value}" }
        val body = request.body.asText()
        
        val log = "$method $path $query $headers $body"
        println(log)
        
        // Invoke the next filter or handler in the chain
        next(call)
    }
}
```

This filter logs the request method, path, query string, headers, and body to the console.

### Handlers

Handlers are used to process requests and generate responses. They have access to the request's ```Parameters```, ```Headers```, ```Attributes```, and ```Body```.

Handlers are registered in the application's ```configuration``` file:

```kotlin
// Register a handler for all requests
configuration.addHandler("MyHandler", "/*") {
    // ...
}

// Register a handler for specific requests
configuration.addHandler("MyHandler", "/my-path") {
    // ...
}
```

Once a handler is registered, it will be invoked for all matching requests. The handler can set ```Headers``` and ```Attributes``` on the response, which will be available to filters and other handlers.

#### Handler Example

Here's a simple example of a handler that returns a "Hello, World!" response:

```kotlin
class HelloWorldHandler : Handler {
    override fun invoke(call: Call) {
        val response = call.response
        response.status = Status.OK
        response.body = "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```

This handler sets the response status to ```200 OK``` and the body to "Hello, World!".

## Routing

Routing is used to map requests to handlers. There are two ways to do this: through configuration and code.

### Configuration

Routing can be configured in the application's ```configuration``` file:

```kotlin
configuration.addRoute("MyRoute", "/my-path") {
    // ...
}
```

Once a route is registered, it will be invoked for all matching requests. The route has access to the request's ```Parameters```, ```Headers```, and ```Body```. It can also set ```Headers``` and ```Attributes``` on the request, which will be available to filters and handlers.

#### Route Example

Here's a simple example of a route that maps requests to the "Hello, World!" handler:

```kotlin
class HelloWorldRoute : Route {
    override fun invoke(call: Call, next: Next) {
        val request = call.request
        val path = request.path
        
        if (path == "/hello-world") {
            val handler = HelloWorldHandler()
            handler(call)
        } else {
            // Invoke the next route in the chain
            next(call)
        }
    }
}
```

This route checks the request path. If it's "/hello-world", it invokes the "Hello, World!" handler. Otherwise, it invokes the next route in the chain.

### Code

Routing can also be done in code:

```kotlin
val route = Route {
    // ...
}

configuration.addRoute(route)
```

Once a route is registered, it will be invoked for all matching requests. The route has access to the request's ```Parameters```, ```Headers```, and ```Body```. It can also set ```Headers``` and ```Attributes``` on the request, which will be available to filters and handlers.

#### Route Example

Here's a simple example of a route that maps requests to the "Hello, World!" handler:

```kotlin
val route = Route {
    val request = it.request
    val path = request.path
    
    if (path == "/hello-world") {
        val handler = HelloWorldHandler()
        handler(it)
    } else {
        // Invoke the next route in the chain
        it.next()
    }
}
```

This route checks the request path. If it's "/hello-world", it invokes the "Hello, World!" handler. Otherwise, it invokes the next route in the chain.

## Best Practices

Here are some general best practices to keep in mind when working with Kotlin MVC architecture:

- Use filters for pre-processing tasks such as authentication, authorization, input validation, and logging.
- Use handlers for processing requests and generating responses.
- Use routes for mapping requests to handlers.
- Keep your code clean and concise.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Follow the DRY Principle.
- Follow the KISS Principle.
