# Kotlin and JWT: Advanced Topics and Best Practices

The development learning blog welcomes you to another comprehensive and practice-oriented article. This time, we will be discussing Kotlin and JWT. We'll be covering advanced topics and best practices related to development, so Kotlin developers can take their skills to the next level.

As always, we would like to remind our readers that the blog is available in other languages. If you're interested in reading this article in German, click [here](). If you're interested in reading this article in Spanish, click [here]().

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and can also be compiled to JavaScript source code. Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, the company behind the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

The Kotlin project started in 2010, and the first stable release was in February 2016. Since then, Kotlin has become one of the most popular programming languages, and it is now the official language for Android development.

## What is JWT?

JWT is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.txt)) that defines a compact and self-contained way of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.

JWT is used in authentication and information exchange between parties in a distributed system. In a typical scenario, a user is authenticated with a third-party service, and the service issues a JWT that the user can then use to access other resources.

## What are the benefits of using Kotlin with JWT?

There are many benefits to using Kotlin with JWT. First, Kotlin is a very concise language, and the JWT format is also concise. This makes it easy to read and write JWT-based applications in Kotlin. Second, Kotlin has great support for various JSON libraries, which makes it easy to work with JWT claims and payloads. Finally, Kotlin's type system and null safety features help to avoid common errors when working with JWT.

## How do I get started with Kotlin and JWT?

In this section, we will show you how to get started with Kotlin and JWT. We will assume that you are already familiar with the basics of Kotlin and JSON.

### Installing the Dependencies

Before we can start coding, we need to install the Kotlin compiler and the JSON library. We will be using the [Kotlin Compiler](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html) and the [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library.

Kotlin can be installed using a package manager such as Maven or Gradle. For Jackson, we need to add the following dependency to our `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.11.+'
```

### Creating the Project

Now that we have all the dependencies installed, we can create a new Kotlin project. We will name our project `jwt-kotlin`.

### Generating a JWT

Now that we have our project set up, we can start writing some code. Let's start by writing a function that generates a JWT. We will use the `jwk-set-pub` library to generate the JWT.

```kotlin
import com.auth0.jwk.JwkSet
import com.auth0.jwk.Jwk

fun generateJwt(jwkSet: JwkSet, keyId: String): String {
    // Get the JWK for the given key ID
    val jwk: Jwk = jwkSet.getKey(keyId)

    // Create a JWT with the JWK
    val jwt = JWT(jwk)

    // Set the claims
    jwt.claims
        .setSubject("kotlin-jwt")
        .setIssuer("https://kotlin-jwt.com")
        .setExpiration(Date(Date().time + 5 * 60 * 1000)) // 5 minutes

    // Sign the JWT
    return jwt.sign()
}
```

In the code snippet above, we first imported the `jwk-set-pub` library. We then created a function that takes a `JwkSet` and a `keyId` as input and returns a `String` containing the JWT. Next, we retrieved the JWK for the given `keyId` from the `JwkSet`.

After that, we created a new `JWT` object with the `JWK`. We then set the claims for the `JWT`. In this example, we set the `subject`, `issuer`, and `expiration` claims. Finally, we signed the `JWT` with the `sign()` method and returned the signed `JWT`.

### Verifying a JWT

Now that we know how to generate a JWT, let's write a function that verifies a JWT. We will use the `jwk-set-pub` library to verify the JWT.

```kotlin
import com.auth0.jwk.JwkSet
import com.auth0.jwk.Jwk

fun verifyJwt(jwkSet: JwkSet, jwt: String): Boolean {
    // Get the header from the JWT
    val header: Map<String, Any> = JWT.getHeader(jwt)

    // Get the kid from the header
    val kid: String? = header["kid"] as String?

    // Get the JWK for the given kid
    val jwk: Jwk = jwkSet.getKey(kid)

    // Verify the JWT
    return JWT.verify(jwt, jwk)
}
```

In the code snippet above, we first imported the `jwk-set-pub` library. We then created a function that takes a `JwkSet` and a `jwt` as input and returns a `Boolean` indicating if the `jwt` is valid.

Next, we retrieved the header from the `jwt` with the `getHeader()` method. We then retrieved the `kid` from the header. After that, we retrieved the `JWK` for the given `kid` from the `JwkSet`. Finally, we verified the `jwt` with the `verify()` method and returned the result.

## Advanced Topics

In this section, we will discuss some advanced topics related to Kotlin and JWT.

### Encoding and Decoding JWTs

In the previous section, we saw how to generate and verify JWTs. In this section, we will see how to encode and decode JWTs. We will be using the `jwt-kotlin` library for this.

The `jwt-kotlin` library provides the `JWT.encode()` method for encoding JWTs, and the `JWT.decode()` method for decoding JWTs.

The `JWT.encode()` method takes a `JWT` object and an `Encoder` object as input and encodes the `JWT` into a `String`. The `Encoder` object defines the encoding algorithm to be used. The `jwt-kotlin` library provides the `Base64Encoder` class for this.

The `JWT.decode()` method takes a `String` containing a JWT and a `Decoder` object as input and decodes the `JWT` into a `JWT` object. The `Decoder` object defines the decoding algorithm to be used. The `jwt-kotlin` library provides the `Base64Decoder` class for this.

### Using JWTs in Web Applications

In this section, we will see how to use JWTs in web applications. We will be using the `jwt-kotlin` and `jwt-kotlin-web` libraries for this.

The `jwt-kotlin-web` library provides the `JwtCookie` and `JwtSession` classes, which make it easy to work with JWTs in web applications.

The `JwtCookie` class represents a JWT stored in a Cookie. The `JwtCookie` class provides the `get()` and `set()` methods for getting and setting the JWT in the Cookie.

The `JwtSession` class represents a JWT stored in a Session. The `JwtSession` class provides the `get()` and `set()` methods for getting and setting the JWT in the Session.

## Best Practices

In this section, we will discuss some best practices for using Kotlin and JWT.

### Use a JWT Library

When working with JWTs in Kotlin, it is best to use a library such as `jwt-kotlin`. The `jwt-kotlin` library provides a number of helpful functions and classes for working with JWTs.

### Keep the JWT Secret Safe

When working with JWTs, it is important to keep the secret safe. The secret should never be stored in plain text or in source code. It should be stored in a secure location such as a configuration file or a database.

### Don't Reuse JWTs

JWTs should not be reused. Once a JWT has been used, it should be invalidated and a new JWT should be generated.

### Use a JWT Blacklist

When working with JWTs, it is a good idea to maintain a blacklist of JWTs that have been invalidated. This will help to prevent replay attacks.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have discussed Kotlin and JWT. We have covered advanced topics and best practices related to development, so Kotlin developers can take their skills to the next level.
