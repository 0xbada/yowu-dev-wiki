# Kotlin and Authorization: Implementing Role-Based Access

With the release of Kotlin 1.3, a new authorization library called "K authorization" has been added to the Kotlin standard library. This library provides a set of functions and methods for easily implementing role-based access control in Kotlin applications.

In this article, we'll take a look at how to use the "K authorization" library to implement role-based access control in a Kotlin application. We'll start by looking at some of the basics of the library, then we'll see how to use it to implement role-based access control in a simple Kotlin application.

## What is "K authorization"?

"K authorization" is a new library for Kotlin 1.3 that provides a set of functions and methods for easily implementing role-based access control in Kotlin applications. The library is designed to be used with the "Kotlin Security" library, which provides a set of functions and methods for easily implementing security in Kotlin applications.

## Basics of "K authorization"

The "K authorization" library provides a set of functions and methods for easily implementing role-based access control in Kotlin applications. The library is designed to be used with the "Kotlin Security" library, which provides a set of functions and methods for easily implementing security in Kotlin applications.

The "K authorization" library provides two main types of functions: functions for authorizing users and functions for authorizing roles.

The "K authorization" library provides a set of functions for authorizing users. These functions take a user object and a set of roles, and return a Boolean value indicating whether or not the user is authorized to access the resources that are protected by the roles.
