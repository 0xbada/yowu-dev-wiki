# Kotlin and Real-time Communication: Building Chat and Notification Systems

The rise of Kotlin as a JVM language has been meteoric. Since it was first announced as a project by JetBrains in 2010, it has been steadily gaining popularity, and in 2017 it was declared the [second-most loved](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226274/application-development/kotlin-trumpets-its-way-to-second-most-loved-language-in-stack-overflow-developer-survey.html) language in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

One of the key reasons for Kotlin's popularity is its interoperability with Java. This means that Kotlin code can run on any platform that supports Java, making it an attractive option for developers who want to target a wide range of devices.

Another reason for Kotlin's popularity is its support for real-time communication (RTC). RTC is a technology that enables instant communication between two or more parties. It's used in applications like chat, video conferencing, and gaming.

Kotlin's RTC support is based on the Java WebSocket API. The WebSocket API provides a standard way to communicate between browsers and servers. It's designed for real-time applications and is supported by all major browsers.

Kotlin's RTC support makes it an ideal choice for developing chat and notification systems. In this article, we'll show you how to use Kotlin to develop a simple chat system. We'll also show you how to use Kotlin's RTC support to develop a simple notification system.

## Developing a chat system with Kotlin

Developing a chat system with Kotlin is simple. We'll start by creating a new Kotlin project using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

We'll name our project "KotlinChat" and we'll use the default settings for the project.

Once the project has been created, we'll need to add the following dependencies to the build.gradle file:

```kotlin
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.3.5"
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-websockets:1.3.5"
```

The first dependency is for Kotlin's coroutine support. Coroutines are a powerful tool for concurrent programming. They allow you to write code that is asynchronous and non-blocking.

The second dependency is for Kotlin's WebSocket support. We'll use the WebSocket API to communicate with the chat server.

Now that we have the dependencies set up, we can start writing the code for our chat system.

We'll start by creating a new file called Main.kt. This file will contain the entry point for our chat system.

In Main.kt, we'll define a main function. This function will be called when the chat system is started.

```kotlin
fun main() {

}
```

Inside the main function, we'll create a new instance of the ChatClient class. This class will manage the connection to the chat server.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val chatClient = ChatClient()
}
```

Next, we'll call the connect function on the chatClient instance. This function will establish a connection to the chat server.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val chatClient = ChatClient()
    chatClient.connect()
}
```

The connect function will take two arguments: the URL of the chat server and a callback function. The callback function will be called when the connection to the chat server has been established.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val chatClient = ChatClient()
    chatClient.connect("ws://localhost:8080/chat", {
        println("Connected to chat server")
    })
}
```

Once the connection has been established, we can start sending and receiving messages.

To send a message, we'll call the send function on the chatClient instance. This function will take two arguments: the message to be sent and a callback function. The callback function will be called when the message has been sent.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val chatClient = ChatClient()
    chatClient.connect("ws://localhost:8080/chat", {
        println("Connected to chat server")
        chatClient.send("Hello, world!", {
            println("Message sent")
        })
    })
}
```

To receive messages, we'll call the receive function on the chatClient instance. This function will take a callback function as an argument. The callback function will be called when a message has been received.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val chatClient = ChatClient()
    chatClient.connect("ws://localhost:8080/chat", {
        println("Connected to chat server")
        chatClient.send("Hello, world!", {
            println("Message sent")
        })
        chatClient.receive {
            println("Message received: $it")
        }
    })
}
```

The receive function will call the callback function with the received message as an argument.

Now that we've seen how to send and receive messages, let's take a look at the ChatClient class.

The ChatClient class contains the following code:

```kotlin
class ChatClient {

    private val websocket = WebSocket()

    fun connect(url: String, onConnect: () -> Unit) {
        websocket.connect(url) {
            onConnect()
        }
    }

    fun send(message: String, onSend: () -> Unit) {
        websocket.send(message) {
            onSend()
        }
    }

    fun receive(onReceive: (String) -> Unit) {
        websocket.receive {
            onReceive(it)
        }
    }
}
```

The ChatClient class has three functions: connect, send, and receive. We've already seen how to use the connect and send functions.

The receive function is similar to the send function. It takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is called with the received message as an argument.

The ChatClient class also has a websocket property. This property is of type WebSocket. The WebSocket class is a Kotlin wrapper around the Java WebSocket API.

The ChatClient class uses the WebSocket class to communicate with the chat server. The connect, send, and receive functions are all wrappers around the corresponding functions in the WebSocket class.

## Developing a notification system with Kotlin

Developing a notification system with Kotlin is simple. We'll start by creating a new Kotlin project using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

We'll name our project "KotlinNotifications" and we'll use the default settings for the project.

Once the project has been created, we'll need to add the following dependencies to the build.gradle file:

```kotlin
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.3.5"
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-websockets:1.3.5"
```

The first dependency is for Kotlin's coroutine support. Coroutines are a powerful tool for concurrent programming. They allow you to write code that is asynchronous and non-blocking.

The second dependency is for Kotlin's WebSocket support. We'll use the WebSocket API to communicate with the notification server.

Now that we have the dependencies set up, we can start writing the code for our notification system.

We'll start by creating a new file called Main.kt. This file will contain the entry point for our notification system.

In Main.kt, we'll define a main function. This function will be called when the notification system is started.

```kotlin
fun main() {

}
```

Inside the main function, we'll create a new instance of the NotificationClient class. This class will manage the connection to the notification server.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val notificationClient = NotificationClient()
}
```

Next, we'll call the connect function on the notificationClient instance. This function will establish a connection to the notification server.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val notificationClient = NotificationClient()
    notificationClient.connect()
}
```

The connect function will take two arguments: the URL of the notification server and a callback function. The callback function will be called when the connection to the notification server has been established.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val notificationClient = NotificationClient()
    notificationClient.connect("ws://localhost:8080/notifications", {
        println("Connected to notification server")
    })
}
```

Once the connection has been established, we can start sending and receiving messages.

To send a message, we'll call the send function on the notificationClient instance. This function will take two arguments: the message to be sent and a callback function. The callback function will be called when the message has been sent.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val notificationClient = NotificationClient()
    notificationClient.connect("ws://localhost:8080/notifications", {
        println("Connected to notification server")
        notificationClient.send("Hello, world!", {
            println("Message sent")
        })
    })
}
```

To receive messages, we'll call the receive function on the notificationClient instance. This function will take a callback function as an argument. The callback function will be called when a message has been received.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val notificationClient = NotificationClient()
    notificationClient.connect("ws://localhost:8080/notifications", {
        println("Connected to notification server")
        notificationClient.send("Hello, world!", {
            println("Message sent")
        })
        notificationClient.receive {
            println("Message received: $it")
        }
    })
}
```

The receive function will call the callback function with the received message as an argument.

Now that we've seen how to send and receive messages, let's take a look at the NotificationClient class.

The NotificationClient class contains the following code:

```kotlin
class NotificationClient {

    private val websocket = WebSocket()

    fun connect(url: String, onConnect: () -> Unit) {
        websocket.connect(url) {
            onConnect()
        }
    }

    fun send(message: String, onSend: () -> Unit) {
        websocket.send(message) {
            onSend()
        }
    }

    fun receive(onReceive: (String) -> Unit) {
        websocket.receive {
            onReceive(it)
        }
    }
}
```
