# Kotlin Continuous Deployment: Automating the Deployment Process

Developers are always looking for ways to automate the software development process. One of the most important and time-consuming tasks in software development is deployment. Deployment is the process of taking code from a local development environment and pushing it to a production environment. This process can be manual or automated.

There are many benefits to automating the deployment process. Automating deployment can save time, improve consistency, and reduce the chances of human error. In this article, we will focus on how to automate the deployment process using Kotlin.

## Why Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, making it an attractive option for developers who are already familiar with Java. Kotlin is also a concise language, which can lead to more readable and maintainable code.

## Setting up a Kotlin Project

Before we can start automating the deployment process, we need to set up a Kotlin project. We will be using the Gradle build tool to manage our project dependencies and build our project.

We need to create a file called `build.gradle.kts` in the root directory of our project. The `build.gradle.kts` file is used to configure our Gradle build.

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.3.72"
}

group = "com.example"
version = "0.0.1"

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8")
}

tasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile> {
    kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = "1.8"
}
```

The `build.gradle.kts` file is similar to a `build.gradle` file, but it is written in Kotlin. In the `build.gradle.kts` file, we have defined a plugin for the Kotlin programming language and specified the version of Kotlin that we want to use. We have also defined the group and version of our project.

We have also defined a repository where our project dependencies will be resolved. In this case, we are using the JCenter repository. Finally, we have defined a dependency on the Kotlin standard library.

The Kotlin standard library provides a set of core libraries that are necessary for developing Kotlin applications. We have also specified that our project should be compiled for Java 8.

## Automating the Deployment Process

Now that we have a Kotlin project set up, we can start automating the deployment process. We will use the Gradle build tool to automate our deployment process.

The first thing we need to do is create a file called `deploy.gradle` in the root directory of our project. The `deploy.gradle` file contains the configuration for our deployment process.

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.bmuschko.gradle.plugins.tooling-api") version "2.3.3"
}

apply(plugin = "com.bmuschko.tomcat")

group = "com.example"
version = "0.0.1"

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    tomcat "org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core:9.0.33"
    tomcat "org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-logging-juli:9.0.33"
    tomcat "org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-jasper:9.0.33"
}

tomcat {
    httpPort = 8080
    ajpPort = 8009
    enableSSL = false
    keystoreFile = file("src/main/resources/keystore.jks")
    keystorePass = "secret"
    keyAlias = "tomcat"
}

tasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile> {
    kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = "1.8"
}
```

In the `deploy.gradle` file, we have defined a plugin for the Tomcat web server. We have also specified the group and version of our project.

We have also defined a repository where our project dependencies will be resolved. In this case, we are using the JCenter repository. Finally, we have defined dependencies on the Tomcat libraries.

The Tomcat libraries are necessary for deploying our Kotlin application to a Tomcat web server. We have also specified the port that Tomcat should use to listen for HTTP requests.

We have also specified the port that Tomcat should use to listen for AJP requests. AJP is a protocol that is used to communication between a web server and an application server. We have also specified that our application should not use SSL.

Finally, we have specified the location of our keystore file and the password for our keystore. A keystore is a file that contains the cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt data.

## Deploying the Application

Now that we have our deployment process automated, we can deploy our application. We will use the Gradle Tomcat plugin to deploy our application.

To deploy our application, we need to run the `gradle tomcatRun` command. This command will start the Tomcat web server and deploy our application to it.

Once the Tomcat web server is up and running, we can access our application at `http://localhost:8080`.
