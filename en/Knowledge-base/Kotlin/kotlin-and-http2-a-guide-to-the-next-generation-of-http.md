# Kotlin and HTTP/2: A Guide to the Next Generation of HTTP

HTTP/2 is the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the protocol that governs communication between web servers and clients. It is a significant upgrade from HTTP/1.1, the previous version of the protocol, and introduces a number of new features that can improve the performance of web applications.

Kotlin is a programming language that can be used to develop web applications. It is a relatively new language, but it has already gained popularity due to its concise syntax and support for Functional Programming. Kotlin can be used with a number of web frameworks, including the popular Java-based frameworks Spring Boot and JEE.

In this article, we will take a look at how to use Kotlin with the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP/2. We will look at the benefits of using HTTP/2, and how Kotlin can be used to take advantage of these benefits. We will also look at some of the features of HTTP/2 that Kotlin can make use of.

## What is HTTP/2?

HTTP/2 is the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the protocol that governs communication between web servers and clients. It is a significant upgrade from HTTP/1.1, the previous version of the protocol, and introduces a number of new features that can improve the performance of web applications.

Some of the key features of HTTP/2 are:

* **Multiplexing**: HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple requests over a single connection, allowing the server to process multiple requests in parallel. This can significantly improve the performance of web applications, as it reduces the latency associated with opening and closing multiple connections.

* **Header compression**: HTTP/2 uses a compression algorithm to compress headers, resulting in less data being sent over the network. This can reduce the amount of time it takes to load a web page, as well as the amount of data that is sent over the network.

* **Server push**: HTTP/2 allows the server to push resources to the client without the client having to request them. This can be used to improve the performance of web applications, as the client can start processing the pushed resources immediately, without having to wait for a response from the server.

## Benefits of using HTTP/2

There are a number of benefits that can be gained by using HTTP/2, including:

* **Improved performance**: HTTP/2 can improve the performance of web applications by multiplexing requests, compressing headers, and pushing resources to the client.

* **Improved security**: HTTP/2 uses TLS 1.2 or higher to encrypt all data that is sent over the network. This helps to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

* **Better compatibility**: HTTP/2 is designed to be compatible with a wide range of web browsers and servers.

## How can Kotlin be used with HTTP/2?

Kotlin can be used to develop web applications that make use of HTTP/2. Kotlin is a relatively new language, but it has already gained popularity due to its concise syntax and support for Functional Programming. Kotlin can be used with a number of web frameworks, including the popular Java-based frameworks Spring Boot and JEE.

In order to use HTTP/2 with Kotlin, you will need to use a web server that supports HTTP/2. For example, the popular open source web server Apache HTTP Server added support for HTTP/2 in version 2.4.17.

Once you have a web server that supports HTTP/2, you can start developing web applications with Kotlin. The following example shows a simple Kotlin-based web application that uses the Spring Boot framework:

```kotlin
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
class Http2Application {

    @GetMapping("/")
    fun index(): String {
        return "Hello, world!"
    }

}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    runApplication<Http2Application>(*args)
}
```

This example application defines a single endpoint that returns a simple string. However, you can use Kotlin to develop more complex web applications that make use of the features of HTTP/2.

In this article, we have looked at how to use Kotlin with the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP/2. We have looked at the benefits of using HTTP/2, and how Kotlin can be used to take advantage of these benefits. We have also looked at some of the features of HTTP/2 that Kotlin can make use of.
