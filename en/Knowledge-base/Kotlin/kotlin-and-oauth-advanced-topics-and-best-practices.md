# Kotlin and OAuth: Advanced Topics and Best Practices

In this article, we'll take a look at some advanced topics and best practices when using Kotlin with OAuth. We'll cover topics such as using custom scopes, securing your access tokens, and handling errors gracefully.

## Using Custom Scopes

One of the great things about OAuth is that it allows you to specify custom scopes. This can be helpful if you want to limit access to your API to only certain parts of it. For example, you could create a scope called `read_only` that would only allow access to the `GET` methods of your API.

To specify a custom scope, you need to add it to the `scope` parameter when you're requesting the access token. For example:

```kotlin
val accessToken = oauth.getAccessToken("read_only")
```

If you want to use multiple scopes, you can specify them as a space-separated list. For example:

```kotlin
val accessToken = oauth.getAccessToken("read_only user_info")
```

## Securing Your Access Tokens

Once you have an access token, it's important to keep it safe. After all, anyone with your access token can make API requests on your behalf.

One way to keep your access token safe is to store it in a secure location, such as a keystore. The keystore is a system-wide store for cryptographic keys and certificates. Access to the keystore is usually restricted to the root user.

Another way to keep your access token safe is to encrypt it. You can use a library like [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) to encrypt and decrypt your access token.

## Handling Errors Gracefully

When using OAuth, it's important to handle errors gracefully. After all, there are a lot of things that can go wrong when requesting and using access tokens.

One common error is the `invalid_grant` error. This error occurs when the access token is invalid or has expired. If you get this error, you should request a new access token.

Another common error is the `invalid_scope` error. This error occurs when the access token doesn't have the correct scope for the API endpoint that you're trying to access. If you get this error, you should check the scope of your access token and make sure that it matches the API endpoint that you're trying to access.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've looked at some advanced topics and best practices when using Kotlin with OAuth. We've seen how to use custom scopes, how to secure your access tokens, and how to handle errors gracefully.
