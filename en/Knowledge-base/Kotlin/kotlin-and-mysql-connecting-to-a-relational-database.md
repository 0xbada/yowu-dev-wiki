# Kotlin and MySQL: Connecting to a Relational Database

In this article we'll explore how to connect to a MySQL database from Kotlin. We'll look at how to configure the database, write code to perform various operations, and handle errors.

## Configuring MySQL

Before we can start writing code, we need to configure our database. We'll assume that you have MySQL installed and running on your local machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html).

Once MySQL is up and running, we need to create a database and a user that our Kotlin code can use. We can do this by logging into the MySQL console:

```mysql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE kotlindb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE USER 'kotlinuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kotlindb.* TO 'kotlinuser'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

## Connecting to the Database

Now that our database is configured, we can write some Kotlin code to connect to it. We'll use the [JDBC driver](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/) for MySQL, which you can add to your project by including the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.21'
}
```

With the JDBC driver in place, we can write a Kotlin function to connect to the database:

```kotlin
fun connectToDatabase(): Connection? {
    val url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kotlindb"
    val user = "kotlinuser"
    val password = "password"

    return try {
        DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)
    } catch (e: SQLException) {
        null
    }
}
```

This function tries to connect to the database using the `url`, `user`, and `password` that we configured earlier. If the connection is successful, it returns the `Connection` object. If the connection fails, it returns `null`.

## Performing Database Operations

Now that we have a way to connect to the database, we can start writing code to perform various operations. We'll start with a simple example: querying the database for a list of all users.

First, we'll need to write a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```

Next, we'll write a Kotlin function to execute this query:

```kotlin
fun getAllUsers(connection: Connection): List<User> {
    val sql = "SELECT * FROM users"
    val statement = connection.createStatement()
    val resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql)

    val users = ArrayList<User>()

    while (resultSet.next()) {
        val id = resultSet.getInt("id")
        val name = resultSet.getString("name")
        val email = resultSet.getString("email")

        val user = User(id, name, email)
        users.add(user)
    }

    return users
}
```

This function takes a `Connection` object as a parameter. It then creates a `Statement` object and uses it to execute the SQL query. The `executeQuery` method returns a `ResultSet` object, which contains the results of the query.

We can use the `next` method of the `ResultSet` object to loop through the results. For each result, we create a `User` object and add it to the `users` list. Finally, we return the `users` list.

## Handling Errors

So far we've seen how to connect to the database and perform various operations. But what happens if something goes wrong? For example, what if the database is down or the SQL query is invalid?

In Kotlin, we can use the `try`/`catch` mechanism to handle errors. Let's modify our `getAllUsers` function to use `try`/`catch`:

```kotlin
fun getAllUsers(connection: Connection): List<User> {
    val sql = "SELECT * FROM users"

    return try {
        val statement = connection.createStatement()
        val resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql)

        val users = ArrayList<User>()

        while (resultSet.next()) {
            val id = resultSet.getInt("id")
            val name = resultSet.getString("name")
            val email = resultSet.getString("email")

            val user = User(id, name, email)
            users.add(user)
        }

        users
    } catch (e: SQLException) {
        println("An error occurred while executing the SQL query: $sql")
        println(e.message)

        ArrayList()
    }
}
```

In this version of the `getAllUsers` function, we've wrapped the code in a `try` block. If an `SQLException` is thrown, the code in the `catch` block will be executed. In this case, we're simply printing an error message.

It's important to note that the `try`/`catch` mechanism is only suitable for handling errors that can be recover from. For example, if the database is down, we can't do anything to recover from the error, so `try`/`catch` won't be of any use.
