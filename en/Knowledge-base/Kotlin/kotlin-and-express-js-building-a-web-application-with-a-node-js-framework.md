# Kotlin and Express.js: Building a Web Application with a Node.js Framework

Kotlin is a JVM language that can be used to build web applications using a variety of frameworks. In this article, we will focus on using Kotlin with the Express.js framework. Express.js is a Node.js framework that provides a set of tools for creating web applications. It is also possible to use Kotlin with other Node.js frameworks, such as Hapi.js and Koa.js.

## Setting up the project

To start, we need to create a new Kotlin project using the Express.js framework. We can do this using the express-generator tool.

First, we need to install the tool using npm:

```
npm install -g express-generator
```

Next, we can use the tool to generate a new project:

```
express --view=pug my-app
```

This will create a new project in the my-app directory with the Pug template engine configured.

## Running the application

Now that we have a new project, we can start the application by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm start
```

This will start the application on http://localhost:3000. We can access the application in our browser and we should see the default Express.js welcome page.

## Hello world

Let's create a simple "Hello world" route to get started. We can do this by editing the routes/index.js file.

First, we need to import the Express.js router:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
```

Next, we can add a new route for the "/" path:

```javascript
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.send('Hello world');
});
```

This route will render the "Hello world" string when we access the "/" path in our browser.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have seen how to use Kotlin and the Express.js framework to build a web application. We have also seen how to create routes and render templates.
