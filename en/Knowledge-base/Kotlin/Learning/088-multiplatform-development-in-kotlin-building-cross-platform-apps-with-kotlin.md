## Introduction

Kotlin is a multiplatform programming language that allows developers to write code that can run on multiple platforms. This flexibility makes Kotlin an attractive choice for developers who want to target multiple platforms with their apps.

In this post, we'll take a look at what Kotlin is and how it can be used to build cross-platform apps. We'll also explore some of the benefits and drawbacks of using Kotlin for multiplatform development.

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kotlin was created by JetBrains, the company behind the popular Java IDE, IntelliJ IDEA.

Kotlin is designed to be a more concise and expressive alternative to Java. Kotlin code can be compiled to JavaScript, making it possible to write code that runs in the browser. Kotlin also has first-class support for Android development.

## Kotlin for Multiplatform Development

Kotlin's multiplatform support makes it an attractive choice for developers who want to target multiple platforms with their apps. Kotlin code can be compiled to JavaScript, making it possible to write code that runs in the browser. Kotlin also has first-class support for Android development.

One of the benefits of using Kotlin for multiplatform development is that it allows developers to share code between platforms. This can lead to more consistent codebases and fewer bugs.

Another benefit of using Kotlin for multiplatform development is that it allows developers to target multiple platforms with a single codebase. This can save time and effort when developing apps for multiple platforms.

There are some drawbacks to using Kotlin for multiplatform development, however. Kotlin code can be more verbose than Java code, which can make it more difficult to read and maintain. Kotlin also has a smaller community than Java, which can make it more difficult to find help and resources.

## Conclusion

Kotlin is a multiplatform programming language that allows developers to write code that can run on multiple platforms. Kotlin's multiplatform support makes it an attractive choice for developers who want to target multiple platforms with their apps. Kotlin code can be compiled to JavaScript, making it possible to write code that runs in the browser. Kotlin also has first-class support for Android development.
