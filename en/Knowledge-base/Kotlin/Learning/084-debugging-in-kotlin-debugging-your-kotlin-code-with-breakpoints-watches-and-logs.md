# Debugging in Kotlin: Debugging Your Kotlin Code with Breakpoints, Watches, and Logs

Debugging is an essential skill for any developer. It allows you to find and fix errors in your code so that your program runs correctly.

Kotlin is a programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is a statically typed language that is designed to be interoperable with Java. Kotlin is a concise, safe, and powerful language that is growing in popularity.

In this post, we will learn how to debug Kotlin code using breakpoints, watches, and logs. We will also learn about some of the best practices for debugging Kotlin code.

## What is a Breakpoint?

A breakpoint is a point in your code where the execution of your program will pause. This allows you to examine the state of your program and see what is going on. Breakpoints are very useful for debugging because they allow you to narrow down where the problem is in your code.

There are two types of breakpoints: line breakpoints and method breakpoints. Line breakpoints are set on a specific line of code and will pause the execution of your program when that line is reached. Method breakpoints are set on a specific method and will pause the execution of your program when that method is called.

You can set breakpoints in Kotlin using the following syntax:

```kotlin
val x = 5

x.setBreakpoint() // line breakpoint

fun foo() {
    // ...
}

foo.setBreakpoint() // method breakpoint
```

## What is a Watch?

A watch is a variable that you are monitoring while your program is running. You can set watches in Kotlin using the following syntax:

```kotlin
val x = 5

x.watch() // watch x

fun foo() {
    // ...
}

foo.watch() // watch foo
```

## What is a Log?

A log is a message that you can print out while your program is running. This can be useful for debugging because you can see what is going on in your code at a specific point in time. You can set logs in Kotlin using the following syntax:

```kotlin
val x = 5

x.log() // print x

fun foo() {
    // ...
}

foo.log() // print foo
```

## Best Practices for Debugging Kotlin Code

Here are some best practices for debugging Kotlin code:

- Use breakpoints to narrow down where the problem is in your code.
- Use watches to monitor variables while your program is running.
- Use logs to print out messages while your program is running.
- Be patient and methodical when debugging. It can be frustrating, but take your time and you will eventually find the problem.
