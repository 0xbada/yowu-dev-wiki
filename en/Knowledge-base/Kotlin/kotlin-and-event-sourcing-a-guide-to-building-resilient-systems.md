Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for JVM, Android and the browser. It is concise, safe, interoperable and tool-friendly. Kotlin can be used for any kind of development, be it server-side, client-side, or Android.

Kotlin is a great fit for event sourcing. Event sourcing is a technique for persisting application state as a sequence of events. In event sourcing, each entity in the system has its own event log. When an entity is changed, a new event is appended to its event log. The current state of the entity can be reconstructed by replaying its event log.

Event sourcing has many benefits. It can make your system more resilient to hardware and software failures. It can also make your system more scalable. And it can make your system easier to debug and audit.

In this article, we'll see how to use Kotlin and event sourcing to build a resilient system. We'll start by looking at the benefits of event sourcing. Then we'll see how to implement event sourcing in Kotlin. And finally, we'll see how to use Kotlin and event sourcing to build a resilient system.

### The benefits of event sourcing

When an entity is changed, a new event is appended to its event log. The current state of the entity can be reconstructed by replaying its event log.

In Kotlin, we can implement event sourcing using the built-in support for immutable data structures. Immutable data structures are data structures that cannot be modified. They are thread-safe and can be shared freely.
