# Git Reflog

Git reflog is a powerful tool for recovering lost commits or branches. Reflog keeps track of the history of your Git repository, including all the changes you've made, even if you've deleted them. This can be useful for recovering lost commits or branches that were accidentally deleted. 

## How to Use Git Reflog

To view the Git reflog, use the following command:

```
git reflog
```

This will display a list of all the changes made to your Git repository, including commits, merges, and other operations. Each entry in the reflog includes the hash of the commit, the operation that was performed, and a description of the operation.

You can use the hash of a lost commit or branch to recover it by creating a new branch or resetting the current branch to the lost commit.

## Reflog Example

Let's say you accidentally deleted a branch that contained an important commit. You realize your mistake a few days later and want to recover the lost commit.

To do this, first, use the `git reflog` command to view the history of your Git repository:

```
git reflog
```

This will display a list of all the changes made to your Git repository, including commits, merges, and other operations. Identify the hash of the lost commit, and use it to create a new branch:

```
git checkout -b new-branch <commit-hash>
```

This will create a new branch at the lost commit, allowing you to recover the changes made in that commit.

> - Reflog can be a powerful tool for recovering lost commits or branches, but it should be used with caution.
> - Changing the commit history of a shared branch can create confusion and issues for other team members.
> - It's important to understand the potential risks and benefits of using Git reflog before incorporating it into your workflow.
