# What is Docker

Docker is an open source container platform that enables developers to package applications into containers for easy deployment and management. A container is a sandboxed environment created by Docker in which applications can be run isolated from the host environment. Containers allow applications to be packaged with their own versions of libraries, frameworks and settings so that developers can ensure the consistency of application behavior even in different environments. 

## Benefits of Dockerizing a Node.js Application

Dockerizing a Node.js application can have numerous benefits. Firstly, it helps automate the packaging and deployment of the application, allowing developers to quickly iterate and deploy changes in an efficient manner. Secondly, it helps to ensure consistency between different environments (such as development, testing, and production environments). By running the application in an isolated container, developers can be sure that their application will behave the same regardless of the underlying system. Thirdly, Docker can be used to scale up or down the application depending on the workload, allowing for better resource optimization across application instances.

Additionally, Docker can make application deployment tougher and more secure by isolating applications from each other and from the host environment. By default, running a containerized application in Docker makes it easier to establish a secure connection between the application and the user or other applications, which can be an advantage over traditional hosting solutions. 

Lastly, in addition to security and performance benefits, Docker can also help lower the cost of application deployment. By making applications easier to deploy, the application can be ran in numerous hosting service providers for lower costs.

## Dockerizing a Node.js Application

Dockerizing a Node.js application is not complicated. The first step is to create a **Dockerfile**, which instructs Docker how to build the image. Generally, a Dockerfile should define the base image, any dependencies and environment variables, and the command to run the application.

Once the Dockerfile is ready, the next step is to build the image. To do this, the developer runs a shell command inside the root directory of the application. The format of the command is `docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> .`. The `-t` flag is used to assign a name to the image, and the last part (`.`) is the name of the directory where the Dockerfile is located. 

Once the image is built, the developer can run the container and make it accessible, by running the following command: `docker run -p <PORT_NUMBER>:<PORT_NUMBER> <IMAGE_NAME>`. Here, the `-p` flag is used to map a port number from the host to the container, so that the application can be accessible from outside.

Once the container is running, the application can be accessed from the specified port. The application is now dockerized and can be deployed on any platform that supports Docker. 

>**Additional Informations**: In addition to the steps mentioned above, there may be additional steps required for complex applications. For example, for applications using databases, additional configuration may be required to set up a connection between the database and the application.{.is-info}

## Testing and Debugging Dockerized Node.js Applications

Testing and debugging a dockerized Node.js application is different from regular applications. Since the application is running inside a container, attaching a debugger is not always possible or straightforward. Fortunately, there are various ways to test and debug the application. 

One approach is to log application data to the console. For example, a developer can utilize npm libraries such as `debug` or `winston` which can be used to log application state and errors to the console. This will help the developer to identify and rectify any issues quickly. 

>**Warning**: Since the application is running inside a container, debugging and testing should be done inside the container.{.is-warning}

>**Danger**: The application should not be debugged or tested in the host environment as it might lead to unexpected and undesired behavior.{.is-danger}

Another approach would be to look into the filesystem, which can be done by running a `docker exec` command to run a command inside the container. This comes in handy for checking database logs or other files that are being created by the application. 

Lastly, a developer can use tools such as `pprof` or `gvisor` which can be used to analyze and improve the performance of the application. 

## Summary

- Dockerizing a Node.js application helps to automate the packaging and deployment process, while also ensuring consistency between different environments.
- Dockerizing the application consists of creating a Dockerfile, building the image, and running the container.
- Debugging and testing a dockerized Node.js application can be done by logging application data to the console, by looking into the filesystem, or by using performance analysis tools.
