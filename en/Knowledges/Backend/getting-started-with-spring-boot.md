# Introduction

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro-service. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production-ready spring applications. It simplifies the development process by providing pre-configured set of tools and libraries. It also provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications that you can “just run”.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a framework that allows developers to quickly create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. It provides a wide range of features, including dependency injection, data access, transaction management, and security. It also provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications that you can “just run”.

Spring Boot is designed to be easy to use and to provide a wide range of features. It is based on the popular Spring Framework and provides a number of features that make it easier to develop applications. It also provides a number of features that make it easier to deploy and manage applications.

## Benefits of Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides a number of benefits for developers, including:

- Easy to use: Spring Boot provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. It also provides a wide range of features that make it easier to develop and deploy applications.

- Flexible: Spring Boot is designed to be flexible and extensible. It can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple web applications to complex enterprise applications.

- Scalable: Spring Boot is designed to be scalable and can be used to create applications that can scale to meet the needs of a large number of users.

- Secure: Spring Boot provides a number of features that make it easier to secure applications. It also provides a number of features that make it easier to monitor and manage applications.

## Getting Started with Spring Boot

Getting started with Spring Boot is easy. All you need to do is download the Spring Boot starter project and follow the instructions.

### Step 1: Download the Spring Boot Starter Project

The first step is to download the Spring Boot starter project. You can download the starter project from the [Spring Boot website](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

### Step 2: Create a Project

Once you have downloaded the starter project, you can create a project using the Spring Boot CLI. To do this, open a command line window and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the starter project.

Once you are in the directory, you can use the `spring init` command to create a project. This command will create a project with the default settings.

### Step 3: Configure the Project

Once you have created the project, you can configure it to meet your needs. You can do this by editing the `application.properties` file. This file contains the configuration settings for the project.

### Step 4: Run the Project

Once you have configured the project, you can run it using the `spring run` command. This command will start the project and you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Step 5: Deploy the Project

Once you have tested the project, you can deploy it to a production environment. To do this, you can use the `spring deploy` command. This command will deploy the project to the specified environment.
