# Dockerizing your Node.js Applications

When developing a Node.js application, it is difficult to efficiently manage the application's dependencies and runtime environment. To address this issue, Docker can be used to containerize the application, providing an isolated environment and allowing the application to run with little modification. This allows developers to quickly deploy their application on any machine with Docker. In this wiki, we'll explore the process of containerizing your Node.js application with Docker.

## Creating a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a set of instructions used to define how a Docker image should be built. It contains instructions for building the application environment and for running the application. To create a Dockerfile for your Node.js application, follow the steps below:

1. Create a directory for your Dockerfile.
2. Create a new file ```Dockerfile``` in the newly created directory and add the following content:

```
FROM node:12-alpine as builder

ADD . /work/src
WORKDIR /work/src

RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

FROM node:12-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /work/src/package.json ./
COPY --from=builder /work/src/dist ./

RUN npm install --production

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["node", "./dist/server.js"]
```

This Dockerfile creates two images, one for building the Node.js application and one for running it. The first image (```node:12-alpine```) is the base image and is used for both building and running the application. The second image only contains the application's dependencies and the compiled code.

3. Edit the Dockerfile to include instructions for installing any dependencies the application needs and for running the Node.js application.
4. Build the Docker image by running ```docker build``` in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the Docker image has been built, it can be run as a container. To run the container, use the ```docker run``` command. This will run the container in the foreground and provide access to the container's output.

```
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 <image-id>
```

This command will start a container using the specified Docker image, mapping the host port 8080 to the container port 8080. Once the container is running, the Node.js application will be running inside it.

## Managing the Container

When running a container, it is often necessary to manage the container's resources and configuration. This can be done using the ```docker container``` command.

```
$ docker container ls
```

This command will list all the running Docker containers. This can be used to view information about the container, such as its configuration, size, and networks.

## Troubleshooting

When running Docker containers, it is important to be able to troubleshoot any errors or issues that might arise. The ```docker logs``` command can be used to view a container's log output. This can be used to identify any issues that might be occurring in the application.

If there is an issue with the application, it can be debugged by running the container interactively using the ```docker exec``` command. This will give the user access to the container, allowing them to inspect the container's environment and make any necessary changes.

## Removing the Container

Once the Node.js application has been successfully running in the Docker container, it can be removed by running the ```docker container rm``` command.

## Summary

Docker can be used to containerize Node.js applications, making it easier for developers to deploy their applications on any machine with Docker. This process involves creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, running the container, managing the container, and troubleshooting any issues that might arise. Finally, the container can be removed when the application is no longer needed.
