# Dockerizing your Node.js applications

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that is used to package and deploy applications as isolated containers. It is often used to build and deploy large-scale web applications, as it allows you to package applications into ready-to-run containers and ship them anywhere. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to Dockerize our Node.js applications - from the basics to more advanced techniques.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for containerizing applications, enabling developers to package, deploy, and run applications in an isolated environment. Containers are instances of a single image that can run on either Linux or Windows. Docker enables applications to be deployed much faster than traditional deployments, as it eliminates the need for manual server configuration and installation.

Docker containers can be used to quickly package and deploy any application, from a simple web server to a complex microservice architecture. The advantage of using Docker is that it allows you to treat the underlying infrastructure as a black box: you don't need to worry about configuring the server or setting up databases, as all of the necessary components are already bundled in the container image.

## Getting Started with Dockerizing Node.js Applications

Before you start Dockerizing your Node.js applications, you'll need to install Docker on your system. Docker is available for both Windows and Linux systems. For Linux, you can install the ```docker``` command-line tool from your package manager. On Windows, Docker can be installed via either the Docker Desktop application or the Docker Toolbox.

Once you have installed Docker, it's time to start Dockerizing your Node.js applications. Before you do so, you should first understand the general structure of a Docker image and how it can be used to create a containerized version of your application.

## The Dockerfile

A Docker image is packaged using the ```Dockerfile```. This file describes the components that are needed to build the image, such as the base operating system, installed packages, and user-defined configuration settings. A typical Dockerfile looks something like this:

```
# Specify the base image
FROM node:latest

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run application
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

This example Dockerfile will pull the ```node:latest``` image from Docker Hub, create a directory for the application, install dependencies listed in the ```package.json``` file, copy the application source code into the image, and finally configure the image to run the application on port ```8080```.

Once the Dockerfile is created, you can now build an image by running ```docker build```. This command will use the Dockerfile to package the application into an image that can be used to create a container. You can also pass in additional arguments to customize the image that is built, such as the version of Node.js to use.

## Creating a Container

Once the image has been built, it can be used to create a container. The ```docker run``` command is used to create a container from an image. This command accepts various arguments, such as attaching host ports to the container and mounting volumes. 

For example, the following command will use the ```node:latest``` image to create a container and attach port ```8080``` of the host machine to port ```8080``` of the container:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d node:latest
```

The ```-d``` flag indicates that the container should be run in the background. This command will create a container that will listen for requests on port ```8080``` of the host machine.

## Sharing Containers

Once you have created a container from an image, you can share this container with others by pushing it to a registry, such as Docker Hub. To push an image to a registry, you can use the ```docker push``` command. This command will send the image to the registry and make it available for other users to pull.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned the basics of Dockerizing Node.js applications. We discussed what Docker is, how to create a Dockerfile, how to build images and create containers, and how to share containers with others. Dockerizing your Node.js applications is a great way to package and deploy your applications quickly and easily.
